## Title

**J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter, and Rejection**

---

## Core Story (Full Version – 8–10 minutes)

Before *Harry Potter* became one of the most successful stories in history, J.K. Rowling was struggling on almost every level.

She was a single mother.
She was unemployed.
She was living on government assistance.

By her own words, she was as close to failure as a person could be without losing hope entirely.

What she did have was a story.

She wrote the first *Harry Potter* book in cafés, often while her daughter slept beside her. Writing wasn’t glamorous. It wasn’t easy. It was survival mixed with belief.

When the manuscript was finished, Rowling sent it out to publishers.

It was rejected.

Again.

And again.

And again.

Twelve publishers said no.

Some said it was too long.
Some said children wouldn’t read it.
Some said it wouldn’t sell.

Most people would have taken the hint and quit.

Rowling didn’t.

She wasn’t clinging to certainty.

She was clinging to conviction.

Eventually, a small publisher took a chance.

The rest is history.

*Harry Potter* went on to sell hundreds of millions of copies, inspire movies, theme parks, and generations of readers around the world.

Looking back, Rowling later said that failure had stripped away everything unnecessary.

It left her focused.

Failure didn’t break her.

It clarified her.

## Audience Adaptations

### Sports Lens

Every athlete gets cut, benched, or overlooked.

The ones who succeed treat rejection as training—not a verdict.

### Video Game Lens

Early-game failure doesn’t mean the campaign is over.

It means you haven’t unlocked the path forward yet.

### Sales / Field Work Lens

Every “no” is data.

Rejection doesn’t disqualify you.

Stopping does.
