## Title

**Hello Kitty: A Little Gift, A Big Smile**

---

## Core Story (Full Version – 8–10 minutes)

When Hello Kitty was created in 1974 by the Japanese company Sanrio, no one thought they were building a global empire.

Hello Kitty wasn’t designed to be loud, edgy, or revolutionary.

She didn’t even have a mouth.

She was simple. Cute. Quiet.

Sanrio’s philosophy at the time was something called *“Small Gift, Big Smile.”*

The idea was simple:

Small, thoughtful things can create connection.

Hello Kitty first appeared on a small vinyl coin purse.

That was it.

No massive marketing campaign.
No blockbuster launch.
No grand vision of domination.

Just a tiny character meant to make someone smile.

What made Hello Kitty special wasn’t complexity.

It was **emotional accessibility**.

She had no mouth so people could project their own feelings onto her.

Happy.
Sad.
Comforted.
Lonely.

Hello Kitty met people where they were.

Over time, that quiet connection compounded.

Hello Kitty spread from coin purses to school supplies.
Then to clothing.
Then to toys.
Then to collaborations.

Decades later, Hello Kitty became a **multi‑billion‑dollar global brand**.

Not because she shouted.

But because she connected.

The lesson Sanrio understood early was this:

You don’t need to overwhelm people to reach them.

You just need to make them feel something small—but real.
