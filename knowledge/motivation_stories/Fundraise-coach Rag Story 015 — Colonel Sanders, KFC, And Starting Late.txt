## Title

**Colonel Sanders, KFC, and Starting Late**

---

## Core Story (Full Version – 8–10 minutes)

When people see the face of Colonel Sanders, they assume success came early.

White suit. Confident smile. Global brand.

What they don’t see is how long it took.

Harland Sanders lived most of his life without real success.

He worked dozens of jobs.

Farmhand.
Railroad worker.
Insurance salesman.
Gas station operator.

Many of them failed.

By his mid‑60s, Sanders was broke.

Then came the moment that would have ended most people.

At **65 years old**, Sanders learned he would receive his first Social Security check.

Instead of seeing it as the end, he saw it as the beginning.

He looked at the check and asked himself a simple question:

“What can I do with this?”

What he had was a recipe.

Fried chicken he had been perfecting for years.

So he got in his car and started driving.

Door to door.

Restaurant to restaurant.

He offered his chicken recipe in exchange for a small royalty.

Most people said no.

Some laughed.

Some told him he was too old.

Sanders heard **over 1,000 rejections**.

He kept going.

Eventually, someone said yes.

That yes became Kentucky Fried Chicken.

Not in his 20s.
Not in his 30s.
Not in his 40s.

But in his **mid‑60s**.

Colonel Sanders didn’t win because he was early.

He won because he didn’t quit.

## Audience Adaptations

### Sports Lens

Late bloomers still win championships.

Timing doesn’t decide greatness.

Commitment does.

### Video Game Lens

Some campaigns don’t start strong.

But persistence unlocks the late‑game power spike.

It’s not over until you stop playing.

### Sales / Field Work Lens

Rejection doesn’t care about age.

Success doesn’t either.

The reps who keep asking eventually get the yes.
