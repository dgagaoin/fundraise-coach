## Title

**The Lion and the Mouse: Small Acts, Big Impact**

---

## Core Story (Full Version – 8–10 minutes)

There is an ancient fable attributed to Aesop about a lion and a mouse.

One day, a mighty lion is sleeping when a small mouse accidentally runs across his paw.

The lion wakes and easily traps the mouse beneath his claws.

The mouse trembles.

It begs for mercy.

It promises that if the lion spares its life, one day it may repay the kindness.

The lion laughs.

How could something so small ever help something so powerful?

Still amused, the lion lets the mouse go.

Days later, the lion is caught in a hunter’s net.

He roars.

He struggles.

But the more he fights, the tighter the net becomes.

Hearing the lion’s cries, the mouse rushes over.

Using its small teeth, the mouse gnaws at the ropes.

Thread by thread, the net breaks.

The lion is freed.

The lion realizes something profound:

Strength alone didn’t save him.

Kindness did.

The smallest act—mercy shown to the mouse—returned as freedom when it mattered most.
