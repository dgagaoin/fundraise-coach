## Title

**Viktor Frankl and Meaning in Suffering**

---

## Core Story (Full Version – 8–10 minutes)

Viktor Frankl was an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist.

During World War II, he was imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz.

He lost his parents, his brother, and his pregnant wife.

Everything he had built—his career, his home, his future—was taken from him.

Frankl lived in conditions designed to strip people of their dignity, identity, and hope.

And yet, he observed something profound.

Some people survived.

Not because they were stronger.
Not because they were healthier.

But because they had **meaning**.

Frankl noticed that prisoners who found a reason to live—someone to return to, work left unfinished, a belief they still carried—were more resilient to suffering.

Others, who lost all sense of meaning, often gave up even when their bodies could still go on.

Frankl realized that while everything could be taken from a person, **one thing remained**:

The freedom to choose one’s attitude.

Even in the worst conditions imaginable.

Frankl chose to survive.

He imagined himself lecturing in the future, teaching others what he was learning inside the camps.

That vision became his anchor.

After the war, Frankl wrote *Man’s Search for Meaning*, one of the most influential books of the 20th century.

His core message was simple, but devastatingly powerful:

Life is not about avoiding suffering.

It is about finding meaning *through* it.
