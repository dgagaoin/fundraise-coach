## Title

**EJAE and the Bigger Stage**

---

## Core Story (Full Version – 8–10 minutes)

Before EJAE ever stood on a global stage, her dream was simple and specific.

She wanted to be a K‑pop idol.

She trained.
She auditioned.
She worked relentlessly in an industry known for being brutally selective.

And like many talented artists, she was told **no**.

Not once.
Not twice.

She didn’t fit what companies were looking for at the time.

For someone chasing a dream, rejection like that can feel final.

But EJAE didn’t stop creating.

Instead of standing in front of the camera, she moved behind it.

She became a songwriter.

She poured everything she had—emotion, discipline, identity—into music for others.

Years later, something unexpected happened.

EJAE became a key creative force behind *K‑Pop Demon Hunters*, a global hit that blended music, animation, and storytelling.

Her voice, vision, and artistry reached **millions**—not as a single idol, but as a creator shaping an entire world.

On a global stage, EJAE received recognition that surpassed what she once imagined.

Awards.
Respect.
Influence.

Not because she forced the original dream to work.

But because she stayed aligned with her craft.

The rejection didn’t end her path.

It **redirected** it.

And the version of success she reached was bigger, broader, and more lasting than the one she first chased.

A side quest opens.
