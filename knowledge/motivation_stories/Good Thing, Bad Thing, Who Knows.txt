## Title

**Good Thing, Bad Thing… Who Knows?**

---

## Core Story (Full Version – 8–10 minutes)

There’s an old story, often told in Taoist tradition, about a farmer and his horse.

One day, the farmer’s horse runs away.

The neighbors hear the news and come by saying, “That’s terrible. Such bad luck.”

The farmer simply replies:

“Good thing, bad thing… who knows?”

A few days later, the horse returns—bringing with it several wild horses.

Now the neighbors celebrate. “How wonderful! What great luck!”

Again, the farmer responds:

“Good thing, bad thing… who knows?”

Soon after, the farmer’s son tries to ride one of the wild horses. He’s thrown off and breaks his leg.

The neighbors rush over. “How awful. Such bad luck.”

The farmer answers the same way:

“Good thing, bad thing… who knows?”

Weeks later, soldiers come through the village to conscript young men into the army.

Seeing the son’s broken leg, they pass him by.

The neighbors return, amazed. “Your son was spared. What incredible luck!”

The farmer smiles gently and says:

“Good thing, bad thing… who knows?”

The point of the story isn’t that good or bad things don’t happen.

They do.

The point is that **we rarely know what an event truly is in the moment**.

What looks like a disaster today may become a blessing tomorrow.

What looks like a win today may create problems later.

Peace doesn’t come from controlling outcomes.

It comes from not attaching meaning too quickly.

## Audience Adaptations

### Sports Lens

A loss can reveal weaknesses.

A win can hide them.

The athlete who stays even-keeled learns faster than the one who rides emotional highs and lows.

### Video Game Lens

Failing a mission might unlock a better strategy.

Winning too easily can leave you unprepared for harder levels.

You don’t know what an outcome means until later.

### Sales / Field Work Lens

A rejection might redirect you to the right donor.

A big win might inflate ego.

Staying calm and unattached keeps you consistent.
