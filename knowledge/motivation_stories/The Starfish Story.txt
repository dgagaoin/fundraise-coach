## Title

**The Starfish Story: Making a Difference Anyway**

---

## Core Story (Full Version – 8–10 minutes)

Along a vast shoreline, thousands of starfish have washed up after a storm.

As far as the eye can see, the beach is covered with them.

An old man walks slowly along the shore.

Every few steps, he bends down, picks up a starfish, and gently throws it back into the ocean.

A passerby watches for a while, then finally calls out:

“Why are you doing that? There are too many. You can’t possibly make a difference.”

The old man pauses.

He bends down again, picks up another starfish, and tosses it into the sea.

Then he turns and says:

“It made a difference to that one.”

The beach doesn’t suddenly clear.

The problem isn’t instantly solved.

But one life is saved.

Then another.

Then another.

The story isn’t about fixing everything.

It’s about refusing to do nothing.

Impact doesn’t require scale.

It requires action.
