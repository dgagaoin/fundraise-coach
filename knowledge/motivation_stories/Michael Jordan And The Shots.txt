## Title

**Michael Jordan and the Shots He Missed**

---

## Core Story (Full Version – 8–10 minutes)

Michael Jordan is widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time.

Six NBA championships.
Five MVP awards.
Countless game-winning shots.

But when people talk about Michael Jordan, they usually talk about what he *made*.

What they don’t talk about is what he *missed*.

Jordan himself once said:

> “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career.
> I’ve lost almost 300 games.
> Twenty-six times, I’ve been trusted

> “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career.
> I’ve lost almost 300 games.
> Twenty-six times, I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed.
> I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life.
> And that is why I succeed.”

That quote alone flips the story people usually tell themselves about success.

Jordan didn’t succeed *despite* failure.

He succeeded *because* he was willing to fail more than anyone else.

He took the shots other people were afraid to take.

He carried the responsibility of missing in front of millions.

And every miss became feedback.

Every failure sharpened him.

Every loss taught him how to win.

Behind every iconic highlight was an invisible mountain of missed shots, blown games, and painful lessons.

Jordan didn’t run from failure.

He studied it.

He used it.

And over time, failure became his greatest advantage.

## Condensed Versions

### 2-Minute Version

Michael Jordan missed over 9,000 shots.

Lost hundreds of games.

Missed game-winners.

And he said that’s *why* he succeeded.

Success wasn’t avoiding failure.

It was learning faster from it.

### 5-Minute Version

Jordan’s greatness wasn’t perfection.

It was volume.

He took more shots.

He accepted more responsibility.

And he failed publicly—then improved.

That’s what separated him.

## Audience Adaptations

### Sports Lens

Every great athlete misses shots.

What separates legends is who keeps shooting.

Confidence isn’t never missing.

Confidence is trusting yourself again after you miss.

### Video Game Lens

You don’t master a boss fight on the first try.

You fail.

You learn patterns.

You adjust.

Each death is data.

Eventually, you win.

### Sales / Field Work Lens

Every rep hears no.

The best reps hear it more often—because they take more shots.

Failure isn’t the opposite of success.

Avoiding action is.

## Message of the Story (Core Lesson)
