## Title

**Wayne Gretzky and the Shots You Don’t Take**

---

## Core Story (Full Version – 8–10 minutes)

Wayne Gretzky is widely considered the greatest hockey player of all time.

Not because he was the biggest.
Not because he was the strongest.
Not because he skated the fastest.

Gretzky’s edge was something else entirely.

Vision.

He saw opportunities before they fully existed.

He once said the line that would become one of the most famous quotes in sports history:

> “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”

What most people don’t realize is that this wasn’t just a clever line.

It was a summary of how he lived and played.

Gretzky took shots other players didn’t even see as options. He passed into space where teammates *would* be. He moved toward where the puck was *going*, not where it had been.

He understood something fundamental:

You can’t score from hesitation.

You can’t win from the sidelines.

You can’t succeed by waiting for perfect conditions.

Every goal Gretzky ever scored was preceded by dozens of missed shots—his and his teammates’.

But the missed shots didn’t scare him.

They informed him.

They taught him angles, timing, and opportunity.

The real failure wasn’t missing.

The real failure was never taking the shot at all.

## Condensed Versions

### 2-Minute Version

Wayne Gretzky said it plainly:

You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.

Misses are part of the game.

But hesitation guarantees zero.

### 5-Minute Version

Gretzky wasn’t fearless because he never missed.

He was fearless because he understood that missed shots were the cost of scoring.

You don’t win by waiting.

You win by taking chances.

## Audience Adaptations

### Sports Lens

Every shooter misses.

Legends keep shooting.

Confidence isn’t accuracy.

Confidence is willingness.

### Video Game Lens

You can’t beat a boss if you never engage.

You learn by attacking, failing, adjusting, and attacking again.

Avoiding the fight guarantees defeat.

### Sales / Field Work Lens

Every sale starts with a question.

Every question risks rejection.

But no ask means no close.

The reps who win are the ones who keep taking shots.
