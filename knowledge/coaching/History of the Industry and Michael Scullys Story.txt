Overview

Michael Scully shares the origin story of BriteVox and his personal journey in the direct sales industry. What began as a temporary summer job became a 35-year career, offering deep lessons on mindset, leadership, training, diversity, and why face-to-face sales continues to thrive—even in the age of the internet and AI.

Industry Origin Story

Michael entered the industry in 1991 after losing his planned summer job due to mass layoffs in the UK. At 18 years old, he accepted a 100% commission, business-to-business sales role selling books, toys, and stationery. His original plan was to stay for just seven weeks. Instead, it became what he calls “the longest summer job of my life.”

At the time, the owner of the sales company was 35 and spoke openly about expanding and opening offices. Michael mentally excluded himself from this future—not because of logic, but because he didn’t see himself as someone that applied to. He later realized this pattern happens constantly in the industry, and it has nothing to do with age.

Early Struggles & the “Matrix Moment”

Michael was not immediately successful. He struggled early but stayed because he needed the money and had no viable alternatives. In his third week, everything began to click—a moment he describes as a “Matrix moment.”

He attributes this breakthrough to:

Showing up consistently

Being coachable

Having someone willing to train him

Choosing to be a good student

This moment marked the beginning of real growth—not just in sales, but in self-awareness.

Competition & Self-Motivation

Michael discovered he was competitive by observing others in the field. He wasn’t outwardly vocal, but internally driven. He learned a critical truth about himself:

He hated losing more than he loved winning.

When his attitude dipped, he would visualize someone else beating him—and use that discomfort as fuel. Over time, he learned to self-motivate in the field without external pressure.

Within six weeks, he had learned so much about himself that he asked:

“What could I become if I committed to this for one year?”

That question changed everything.

Leadership at a Young Age

At just 18 years and one month old, Michael began training people older than himself. He initially didn’t know how to coach older individuals, but he learned a powerful principle:

Results eliminate judgment.

Rather than trying to act older or assert authority, he focused on:

Organization

Discipline

Consistency

Performance

Once results were visible, age stopped mattering. What mattered was proof.

He also learned that regardless of background—age, skin color, or economic status—performance resets the narrative. Every day is a clean slate.

Building Strong Teams

Michael learned early that the strongest teams are the most diverse teams.

While he didn’t fully understand the industry at first, he recognized the power of assembling people with different perspectives and strengths. Over time, he worked across:

Events marketing

Door-to-door sales

Business-to-business sales

Commercial products

Charity fundraising

This led to a key insight:

We are not selling one product.
We are teaching people how to sell anything.

The product—charity, broadband, subscriptions—is simply the training tool.

Face-to-Face Sales in a Changing World

In the 1990s, many believed the internet would eliminate direct sales. Instead, face-to-face sales thrived.

Michael personally worked on campaigns for:

Uber

Netflix

Broadband internet

Commercial and charity products

The lesson: technology changes, but human communication remains essential.

Expansion & Long-Term Vision

There are currently around 22 offices, soon expanding to 28—but Michael believes there could be thousands in the U.S.

He points to countries like Malaysia and Singapore:

Much smaller populations

One company with 750 sales reps doing both commercial and charity sales

The opportunity is far larger than most people imagine.

People, Legacy, and Lifetime Relationships

The people you train and bring along—like Papa Jo, Callum, and other leaders—can become lifelong relationships.

The true goal of expansion is not just growth, but building quality teams with great people.

AI, Automation & the Future

Amazon has deployed over 1 million robots, and some warehouses now operate with only 6–7 humans.

Despite massive technological disruption, several truths remain:

People want opportunity and financial stability

Companies will always seek growth and revenue

Selling will always be required for expansion

As long as businesses need growth, sales organizations that build teams will thrive.

Core Takeaway

Even if people only understand part of this journey at first, learning how to:

Communicate effectively

Develop others

Lead teams

Sell ideas and solutions

…will benefit them wherever life takes them.

This industry doesn’t just sell products—it builds people.
