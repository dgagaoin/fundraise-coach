TRAINING IN THE FIELD
LEADERSHIP & COACHING SYSTEM
==============================

BUILD – What they are doing correct
BREAK – What they need to work on
BUILD – Help them understand that if they combine what they were already doing
        with their new skill, they will be great

Quote:
“If you don’t have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?”
— John Wooden

Core Principle:
Do it right the first time. You can’t get promoted on personal sales alone.
Training others is a critical part of the journey to business ownership.

Pre-Event Setup:
- Travel to the event together when possible
- Make sure your car is clean
- Use the drive to set the tone and structure for the day

Daily Setup Questions:
- What type of event are we going to?
- When do we expect sales to happen and why?
- What skill will we focus on learning or improving today?

Example Daily Setup:
“We’re going to a Walmart, so we need to qualify people and work the Law of Averages.
Walmarts are generally consistent stores, but traffic can be strong later in the day.
Because you’re newer, let’s focus on getting you really good at the short story today,
and see if we can get you doing intros by the end of the day.”

Coaching Method:
BUILD → BREAK → BUILD
- Reinforce what they are doing right
- Identify one improvement area
- Rebuild confidence by integrating the new skill
This works because no one likes being told they are doing something wrong.

Intervention Rule:
- First mistake: let it go
- Second mistake: pay attention
- Third mistake: intervene
Exception:
- If it could jeopardize a client, customer, or store,
  address it immediately or call your leader/owner for guidance

Coaching Mindset:
- Don’t train all the time
- Sometimes people need to relax, have fun, and learn from mistakes
- Over-coaching kills confidence

Prime Time:
Prime Time is YOUR time.
You can teach all you want, but the best way to teach someone how to sell is to SHOW.
Prime Time is your time to demonstrate at a high level.
Turn it up a gear.
