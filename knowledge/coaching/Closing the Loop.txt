## Purpose of This Talk

This talk explains what it means to **“close the loop”** in leadership and training—guiding people beyond basic sales competency and into long-term growth, leadership, and ownership. Closing the loop is about commitment, vision, and deciding **how far you are willing to take someone on their journey**.

## Origin Story: From 8 People to a Movement

Papa Jo reflects on the early days of the organization when there were only **8 people**.

Over four years, that group grew into:

* ~70 people total
* Owners
* Assistant Owners
* Crew Leaders

Those same individuals are now organizing **New Leaders Meetings in Los Angeles**, completing a full generational loop of leadership.

This growth did not happen by accident—it happened through intentional development.

## What “Closing the Loop” Really Means

Closing the loop is not just about teaching sales.

It is about:

* Guiding people *past* the sales phase
* Helping them see the next step
* Deciding how much responsibility and growth you are willing to invest in someone

The process starts internally:

> How far are *you* willing to take someone?

## The Three Bricklayers Story

Papa Jo references the classic **three bricklayers** analogy:

* One sees himself laying bricks
* One sees himself building a wall
* One sees himself building a cathedral

The same work—different meaning.

In fundraising and leadership, meaning determines commitment.

## Vision Drives Focus

Papa Jo’s vision:

> **To be the first-choice agency for all face-to-face solutions.**

The bigger the vision, the bigger the focus required.

Small vision creates small effort.
Big vision demands consistency and discipline.

## The CEO & CFO Training Paradox

A classic leadership conversation:

* **CFO:** “What if we train people and they leave?”
* **CEO:** “What if we don’t train them and they stay?”

The safest way to avoid developing someone is **not committing**.

The most powerful approach:

* Give more
* Build more
* Train deeper
* Expect nothing in return

Train as if you are developing a superstar—**without requiring them to become one**.

This mindset attracts people, builds loyalty, and allows leaders to take others on a journey.

## Learning From Others

Papa Jo openly shares that:

* He was fun to work with
* He attended crew nights
* He built strong relationships

But he was not always the strongest in the field.

Instead of hiding this, he:

* Learned from friends who *were* strong in sales
* Networked new people with top performers
* Built environments where learning traveled horizontally, not just top-down

---

## Closing the Loop: Training Structure

### Leadership Path

* New Start
* First Week Completion
* Sales Independence
* Leadership Development

Leaders must intentionally move people through these stages.

---

### Ownership Training Model

1. **Watch Me**

   * Interviews
   * Morning meetings

2. **Do It Together**

   * Side-by-side execution

3. **I Watch You**

   * Feedback and correction

This creates confidence, competence, and accountability.

---

## Width vs. Depth in Training

Training can happen in two ways:

* **Width:** Training many people at once
* **Depth:** Training fewer people deeply

Both are valid—but shallow training creates shallow culture.

> “Make your bed and you’ll lie in it.”

The way you train determines the organization you live in.

---

## Respect the Learning Curve

Skills are not objects—they are earned.

Every skill has:

* A learning curve
* A price tag
* A process

You must start first and continuously **upskill yourself** before expecting others to grow.

Papa Jo highlights examples of great students:

* Adam Shapiro
* Himself

Including completing a **52-book challenge in one year**.

---

## The Lantern Analogy

The more equipped you are, the more light you can shine.

The more you equip others, the more light fills the environment.

Growth multiplies when knowledge is shared.

---

## Core Takeaway

Closing the loop means:

* Committing to people
* Training without attachment
* Building beyond sales
* Thinking in generations, not days

Leaders don’t just build results—they build **people who build people**.
