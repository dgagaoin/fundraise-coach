## Purpose of This Talk

This talk defines what it truly means to be a **Right Hand Person**—not a title, but a level of responsibility, trust, and execution. Right Hands are the force that makes leadership **duplicable**, culture scalable, and growth sustainable.

---

## Core Philosophy: “Roger 10/4, Captain”

**ROGER** = *Received Orders Given, Expect Results*

Being a Right Hand starts with **absolute alignment**. You follow the leader’s direction fully, even when:

* You aren’t the smartest person in the room
* You don’t look the best
* You don’t get the most credit

Right Hands execute without ego.

---

## What a Right Hand Actually Is

A Right Hand is:

* The **second source of direction and certainty**
* The **bridge** between ownership and the team
* An **extension of the owner**, whether the owner is present or not

Being a Right Hand is not about favoritism—it’s about **trust with the end goal of the business**.

---

## The Three Lanes of Leadership

* **Fast Lane (10%)** – Become Right Hands
* **Middle Lane (80%)** – Follow the crowd
* **Slow Lane (10%)** – Should not be leaders

Right Hands live in the **fast lane**.

Their role is to **bridge gaps** and stabilize execution as a core leader.

---

## Kill Excuses Relentlessly

When excuses show up, the Right Hand becomes the **grim reaper**.

* No co-signing weakness
* No rationalizing poor habits
* No letting standards slide

Excuses die fast around Right Hands.

---

## Trust When No One Is Watching

The true test of a Right Hand is behavior when the owner is absent.

Owners don’t need to check on Right Hands because:

* They’re already early
* They’re already prepared
* They’re already executing

Right Hands **beat the owner to the office**.

---

## Why Right Hands Matter to Growth

An office cannot expand without Right Hands.

They are proof that:

* Leadership is duplicable
* Standards can live inside more than one person

Without Right Hands, growth stalls.

---

## Discipline Under Pressure

Sammy compares this standard to **Navy SEAL training**—holding planks on the beach while waves crash into your face.

The message:

> You hold the line no matter the conditions.

---

## Daily Execution of a Right Hand

### Morning

* Arrive early
* Prepare Primetime
* Be sharp and present
* Take notes
* Ask questions
* Be a student of the game

### During the Day

* Perform in the field
* Train by example
* Support leaders

### End of Day

* Close strong
* Ensure KPIs are completed
* Send reports

Right Hands make the day run smoothly.

---

## Standards Over Emotions

Right Hands are **standards-driven**, not emotion-driven.

They do not ride:

* Mood swings
* Complaints
* Temporary feelings

Consistency over time wins.

---

## Two Types of Standards

### Personal Standards

Sammy opened his office on **January 17, 2022** with three people. Everyone eventually left—he remained.

His personal standards:

* In office by 7:00 AM daily
* Never left before 6:45 PM
* Worked every Saturday

Standards kept him standing when momentum disappeared.

---

### Team Standards

* Performance
* Customer service
* Quality
* Accountability

Do not co-sign BS.

---

## Be a Field Leader

Right Hands:

* Go to the field
* Perform
* Set the example
* Step in when something is wrong

The process:

1. Show how it’s done
2. Watch
3. Correct

Do not just talk—**be about it**.

---

## Create Momentum

Right Hands do not wait for momentum.

They **create it** through:

* Habits
* Presence
* Action

Good leaders model good habits, thoughts, and actions.

---

## Protect the Energy

Right Hands are **energy protectors**.

* The owner doesn’t need to be liked
* The Right Hand cares about people
* Negative talk gets stopped immediately

Team-first mentality always.

---

## Final Separation Point

This role separates:

* Winners from losers
* Those who advance from those who stay stuck

Right Hands:

* Don’t wait to be trusted
* Are simply **trustworthy and undeniable**
* Lead without needing recognition
* Execute in moments that get no applause

Leadership is an **action**, not a position.

**Close the gaps.**
