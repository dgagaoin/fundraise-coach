## Purpose of This Talk

This talk focuses on the **deliberate construction of confidence** in Fundraisers (FRs). Confidence is not treated as personality-based or accidental—it is something leaders actively **engineer through proof, evidence, and experience**, starting on Day 1.

Confidence sells. Confident FRs become independent faster, perform better, and stay longer.

## Why Confidence Matters

Confidence directly impacts:

* Sales performance
* Speed to independence
* Retention and longevity

Confident FRs do not need constant supervision because they **want** to succeed, believe they can succeed, and have evidence that success is possible.

Confidence must be built early and intentionally.

---

## The Confidence Loop

Confidence follows a predictable psychological loop:

**Thoughts → Actions → Results → Confidence → Better Thoughts**

When FRs experience results—especially early—the loop reinforces itself. Leaders must help initiate this loop intentionally.

---

## Setting Clear, Achievable Day Goals

Leaders should set **specific, confidence-building goals** for FRs:

Examples:

* “We’re going to be 100% scoring before lunch.”
* “We’ll be on bells by the end of the day.”
* “Let’s squeeze another one out.”

Also prepare them for **all three types of days**, including late days:

> “I actually want you to experience a late day.”

This reframes difficulty as part of growth and prevents surprise or discouragement.

## Be a Great Hype Leader

Leaders must actively generate emotional momentum.

**Key principles:**

* Deliver praise with hype
* Use varied tonality
* Make praise fun and energetic
* Never sound monotonous

Do not only praise results.

Great leaders praise **process-based behaviors**, including:

* Attitude management
* Rapport building
* Proper pausing
* Technical execution
* Energy and presence

Small improvements matter. Leaders must be excellent at spotting and highlighting them.

## The Leader as the Mirror

New FRs naturally compare themselves to their leader, especially early on.

Common internal thoughts:

* “I’m not as charismatic.”
* “I can’t speak like they do.”
* “I don’t know what they know.”

Leaders must **pre-empt these thoughts out loud** before they take root.

Use personal stories:

* Early mistakes
* Awkward first weeks
* Slow starts

Also use stories of others:

* Some picked it up quickly
* Some struggled early
* Both became high rollers

Teach FRs to compare themselves **only to their own progression**, not to finished products.

## Managing Independence Without Over-Dependency

Early stages require hand-holding—but not too much.

One intentional strategy:

* **Separate lunches on Day 1**

This creates a controlled moment of independence.

Pre-frame it clearly:

> “You’ve got this. I’ll come running out here to help you close someone.”

This builds self-trust without abandonment.

---

## KPIs as Confidence Tools

KPIs are not just measurement tools—they are **confidence-building tools**.

Leaders should:

* Explain KPIs early
* Calculate ratios together using a calculator
* Review what the numbers mean

Then prompt reflection:

* What went well?
* What needs work?
* What do the ratios show?

This keeps FRs logical, grounded, and forward-focused.

---

## Core Takeaway

Early confidence creates momentum.

Momentum creates independence.

Independence creates retention.

Leaders don’t wait for confidence to appear—they **build it deliberately**, using evidence, praise, structure, and belief.
