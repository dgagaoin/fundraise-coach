# Leader Training & Mission-Driven Meetings

## Thinking Bigger About Training

### Money-Focused vs Mission-Motivated (More Powerful)

* Many people come from a **scarcity / hourly-wage mindset**.
* As leaders, we must:

  * **Validate reality** without creating unnecessary pressure.
  * **Build confidence**, not fear.
  * Replace pressure-based motivation with **belief and purpose**.

---

## Income vs Impact

* People often focus only on **income**, not **impact**.
* Strong leaders consistently **link money to mission**.
* Income becomes more meaningful when it is clearly tied to:

  * Helping others
  * Making a difference
  * Long-term growth

## How Leaders Should Train (Linking Money to Mission)

**A)** Lead training with **mission clarity**

**B)** Clearly explain **what our mission is** and why it matters

**C)** Help people **connect to the big picture**, not just today’s numbers

**D)** Anchor emotionally using **real stories**, not just personal stats

**E)** Remember: people perform better when they feel **invested and connected** to the mission

**F)** Celebrate **impact**, not just numbers

**G)** Show the **long-term vision**, plus the small daily actions that lead there

**H)** Create **rituals and reminders** that reinforce why we are here

**I)** Regularly talk about **what funding allows** (real-world outcomes)

**J)** Train leaders to **consistently connect money back to mission**

## What People Are Really Fired Up For in This Job

People stay engaged when they see:

1. **Money ($)**
2. **Mission**
3. **Growth** (personal and professional)

All three must be present.

## Goal Setting as a Leader

* Goals should **include other people**, not just personal outcomes.
* Leaders should be able to clearly explain:

  * How growth happens
  * What growth looks like over time

---

## Retention Insight (Critical)

* The **#1 reason people quit a job is their direct manager**.
* Leadership quality directly determines:

  * Retention
  * Performance
  * Morale
  * Culture

Strong leaders create strong teams.
