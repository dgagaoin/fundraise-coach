## Anderson (Crew Leader)

### What drives you to work hard, especially on tough days?

Anderson identifies two main drivers:

1. **Expectations & Social Proof**
   His journey began with a simple goal: score every day, Monday through Friday, for one week. That small win built confidence and eventually led to a **300+ day scoring streak**. Proof compounded into belief.

2. **Responsibility to His Team**
   His team relies on him. That responsibility creates internal pressure to show up, regardless of the day.

He also notes being motivated by sign-ups—but emphasizes the importance of **wanting results without becoming desperate**.

### What allows you to sustain this?

**Habits.**

* Even during table setup, he talks to everyone he sees
* He treats every moment as an opportunity
* Consistent habits eliminate decision fatigue

## Chase (Crew Leader)

### What helped you when things didn’t click right away?

Chase emphasizes:

* **Social proof**
* **Mastery of the basics**

Keeping everything **textbook** removes friction and guesswork. The principle of **KISS (Keep It Short and Simple)** allows anyone to execute.

When the basics work for others, they can work for you.

### Key Mindset Shift

* Overthinking and procrastination only slow progress
* Every moment in the field is happening *for* you

The question becomes:

> “How do I seize this moment and make it mine?”

## Royler (Crew Leader)

### What put you in a position to succeed?

Royler highlights three pillars:

1. **Future Pacing** – helping people see where they’re going
2. **Training** – meeting people where they are
3. **Relationships** – understanding individual needs

As a leader, he breaks down each day based on what people need most:

* Mindset
* Technical training
* Friendship or mentorship

He also uses performance tracking tools (such as the winelist) to identify trends, isolate specific moments, and adjust behavior precisely.

## Uncle Dez (Crew Leader)

### How did you overcome age-related doubts?

Uncle Dez is a father of three and grandfather of two. When entering the industry, he noticed he was surrounded by much younger people.

However, his background included **20+ years of door-to-door sales**, which shaped his confidence. Compared to that experience, events felt easier—people come to you.

### Key Beliefs

* Age, race, and background are excuses unless you allow them to be
* It’s your responsibility to prove negative assumptions wrong

### Habits That Defined His Success

* Arrived before his boss for **1 year and 7 months**
* Never late
* Focused on consistency over big numbers
* Made his presence matter

He came in as the winner he intended to become.

## Joy (Assistant Owner)

### How did you create strong culture within the AO team?

Joy explains that culture is not built through one big action—it’s built through **many small actions done consistently**.

Key principles:

* Build unity intentionally
* Develop strong relationships with each individual
* Align messaging around shared goals
* Understand who is competitive and engage them accordingly

Tactics include:

* Friendly competitions
* Countdowns
* Small rewards
* Crew nights to connect on a personal level

**Core Insight:**

> Becoming an Assistant Owner doesn’t create culture—culture creates the Assistant Owner.

## Keon (Assistant Owner)

### How are you successful at such a young age?

At 21 years old, Keon recognizes that success requires being different from peers his age.

Key focus:

* Recognizing the **limitless opportunity**
* Choosing to seize it fully

He attributes his success to urgency, awareness, and deliberate effort.

---

## Jay (Assistant Owner)

### How did you persevere through ups and downs?

Jay describes a pivotal mindset shift after a heart-to-heart conversation with Sammy.

Despite having experience and knowledge, he wasn’t giving his all. The issue wasn’t skill—it was mental.

Additional motivation came from competition:

* Keon stated he would reach Assistant Owner first—and did

Rather than discouraging him, this competition pushed Jay to elevate.

---

## Aurelio (Owner)

### What changed in your leadership style?

Aurelio reflects on being perceived as overly aggressive and dictatorial early on.

He realized:

* His personality was big
* He was having too much fun instead of focusing on leadership
* He pushed his own ambitions onto others instead of listening

A turning point came from reading *How to Win Friends and Influence Others* by Dale Carnegie.

### Key Lesson

The simple act of remembering a bellboy’s name—**Ben**—highlighted the power of seeing people as individuals, not roles.

He shifted from prioritizing his own needs to listening to what others wanted.

Leadership became about **influence, empathy, and respect**.

---

## Core Takeaways

Across roles and backgrounds, consistent themes emerged:

* Habits beat motivation
* Social proof builds belief
* Culture is built through small, daily actions
* Consistency matters more than intensity
* Listening creates influence
* Leadership adapts as people grow
