# Performing While Training

### Tali — Setting the Pace, Leading from the Front, and Training as Investment

---

## Core Premise

**Training is not a cost — it is an investment.**

Great leaders do not slow down when they train. They raise the standard.

Performing while training is about setting the pace, proving what’s possible, and showing others how to win — consistently and with confidence.

---

## Leadership Starts With Responsibility

Training begins with a mindset shift:

* It is *your* responsibility to make things happen
* You are not “giving away money” by training others

Some leaders believe training means:

* Doing sales for other people
* Making less money

This mindset is false.

Training well creates future performance, bonuses, promotions, and scale.

---

## Training Is About Standards

As a trainer, you must:

* Set the standard
* Show people you are their leader
* Demonstrate that you will take care of them

Your job is to train people to become **the best version of themselves**.

---

## Goal While Training

The goal while training is simple:

* **High roll the week**

When new starts see that their leader:

* Can sell
* Can perform
* Can hit numbers

Their confidence skyrockets.

Even if you don’t high roll:

* Show what’s possible
* Land close to the goal
* Hit double digits

---

## Be Fully Prepared

When training, everything must be tight:

* KPIs
* Gear
* Mental preparation
* Sense of urgency
* Personal issues handled

New starts are watching everything.

---

## Lead the Day

Whenever possible:

* Be the first to score
* Be the first to get an FPC (First Person Closed sale)

Show that:

* Rejection is part of the game
* Rejection does not phase you

Don’t just sell.

**Set the pace.**

---

## Consistency Is Contagious

* Push every day
* Perform at a high level
* Show up on weekends when needed

People copy what they see:

* 2/3rds of your good habits
* 4/3rds of your bad habits

When training, all eyes are on you.

---

## Train With a Clear Objective

Your objective while training:

* Get new starts hitting bonuses
* Build belief through results

Be clear:

> *“If you’re being trained by me, you will score. You will ring bells. You will hit 3 or more.”*

The pace does not slow down because you are training.

You cannot set a pace you don’t live up to.

---

## Lead From the Field

Tali runs the New Haven, Connecticut office while still hitting the field.

He never wanted to be:

* An owner who stays in the office

He wanted to be:

* A leader who performs in the field

> *“It doesn’t matter what site I’m at — I’m going to make it happen.”*

This inspires belief and buy-in.

---

## Make Winning Fun

* Smash double digits weekly
* Especially on Draw For Hope — this is light work
* Show people how to succeed **and enjoy it**

Fun + performance sets the standard.

---

## Training Creates More Money

When you train well:

* Your team grows
* Bonuses increase
* Promotions come faster

Training forces excellence.

---

## Pressure vs Possibility

Setting the pace while training is not about pressure.

It’s about:

* Showing what’s possible
* Leading with confidence
* Having fun while winning

---

## Core Lesson

**If you want high performers, you must train at a high standard.**

Training is leadership.
Performance is proof.
Standards are contagious.

Set the pace — and live it.
