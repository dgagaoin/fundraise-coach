## Purpose of This Talk

This talk explains **why crew meetings are essential** to building strong teams, promoting leaders, and creating daily consistency in performance. Crew meetings are not optional rituals—they are a leadership tool that directly shapes mindset, behavior, and results in the field.

## Origin Story: Learning the Hard Way

Early in his leadership journey, Torrence did not understand:

* Why crew meetings existed
* What their purpose was
* How they influenced results

For six months, he was unable to promote a leader and struggled to grow his team.

Once crew meetings were implemented consistently, the turnaround was clear:

* Within six months, his team grew to **25 people**

Crew meetings became the catalyst for leadership development and team growth.

## What Crew Meetings Actually Do

Crew meetings influence **how people think throughout the day**.

They are not just about technical skill—they are about:

* Mindset
* Energy
* Confidence
* Unity
* Belonging

Crew meetings create camaraderie and reinforce that individuals are part of something bigger than themselves.

---

## Why Crew Meetings Matter

### 1. Setting the Tone for the Day

People often show up:

* Tired
* Unsure
* Distracted by personal issues

Especially in the first week, mental state matters more than skill.

Crew meetings allow leaders to intentionally model:

* Energy
* Confidence
* Intensity
* Focus

If leaders don’t set the tone, negative behaviors naturally creep in.

---

### 2. Creating Alignment

Alignment is about **shared focus**.

Without alignment:

* Everyone operates on different priorities
* Habits fluctuate
* Accountability weakens

With alignment:

* Teams push toward the same definition of success
* Habits become unified
* Accountability increases

People operate more effectively when they feel part of a coordinated team.

---

### 3. Mental Preparation

Crew meetings remove obstacles *before* they become problems.

Preparation includes:

* Jackets if it’s cold
* Water if it’s hot
* Gloves, canopies, and tools as needed

Torrence compares crew meetings to **sports huddles**.

He played football and asks:

> What would happen if coaches never held huddles before or during a game?

Huddles:

* Set expectations
* Reinforce effort
* Align strategy
* Build belief

The same applies to the field.

---

## Why Setting the Tone Is Critical

Without tone-setting, teams drift.

**Analogy: Group School Project**

* No direction → socializing, confusion, low output
* Clear direction → structure, focus, results

**Analogy: Helping Someone Move**

* No instructions → people stand around, get frustrated
* Clear roles → smooth execution, faster completion

Tone creates clarity.

Clarity reduces stress.

## Mental Preparation Prevents Failure

Most failures aren’t due to inability—they’re due to lack of preparation.

When people aren’t mentally prepared:

* They freeze
* They overthink
* They don’t know what to do

Crew meetings move people from **overthinking to action**.

---

## How to Run an Effective Crew Meeting

### 1. Be Intentional

* Never be random
* Avoid rambling
* Have a clear focus

Every crew meeting should give people **one main thing** to lock into.

---

### 2. Keep It Simple

* 2–5 minutes
* Short and punchy

Focus on:

* Behaviors to prevent
* Messages people need to hear

---

### 3. Lead with Confidence

If the leader lacks confidence, the team will feel it.

Crew meetings must be delivered with:

* Belief
* Certainty
* Presence

Confidence transfers.

---

### 4. End with a Chant

Chants:

* Unite the group
* Raise energy
* Create momentum

Energy going into the field matters.

---

## Core Takeaway

Crew meetings are a **daily leadership reset**.

They:

* Shape mindset
* Build culture
* Create alignment
* Prepare people to execute

When done consistently and intentionally, crew meetings turn groups into teams.
