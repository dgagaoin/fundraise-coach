## Purpose of This Talk

This talk explains how **energy, standards, and integrity** create real culture—and why culture, not strategy, ultimately determines engagement, performance, and long-term success.

Culture is not what you say. Culture is what people **buy into**, respect, and follow.

## Respect vs. Likeability: The Abraham Lincoln Lesson

Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1861 and was not widely admired at the time:

* He spoke awkwardly
* He did not come from an elite background
* Even members of his own cabinet disliked and questioned him

He led the country during the Civil War—the most divided period in U.S. history. Today, he is remembered as one of the greatest presidents of all time because of **integrity**, not popularity.

One of his most important leadership decisions was forming a **“team of rivals”**—surrounding himself with people who held different opinions and perspectives.

**Key Leadership Principle:**

> It is better to be respected than to be liked.

## Modern Example: Holding Standards Builds Culture

Sebastian connects this principle to Sarah Kim:

* She was likable
* She participated in crew nights and team activities
* She also held standards
* She made sure people did the right things, even when it wasn’t popular

Not everyone liked those decisions—but they were respected.

**What people respect, they buy into.**
**What people buy into, they follow.**
**What they follow becomes culture.**

Culture requires values. Without strong values, culture collapses.

## The Four Pillars Sebastian Respects

### 1. Self-Discipline

Self-discipline takes people further than motivation ever will.

Motivation fades. Discipline stays.

Examples of discipline:

* Going to bed at 10pm consistently
* No breaks until OTM
* “I’m either getting one or staying out until I do”

Self-discipline creates reliability—and reliability builds culture.

### 2. Consistent Standards

Sebastian references professional athletes as models of consistency.

High performers are consistent in:

* What they eat
* When they work out
* How they prepare
* How they perform

Professionals live by standards.

**Standards to Live By (The 8 Steps):**

1. Be positive
2. Be on time
3. Be prepared
4. Give 100% effort
5. Work your territory
6. Safeguard your attitude
7. Know your why
8. Take control of your life

Standards define professionalism.

### 3. Integrity

Integrity means:

* Signing up the right people
* Doing the right thing when no one is watching
* Treating everyone fairly and with respect
* Doing right by your team
* Doing right by the charity client
* Doing right by yourself

Integrity creates trust. Trust creates longevity.

### 4. Energy

Sales is a **transfer of energy**.

Without good energy, success is impossible.

**Positive energy is a choice.**

Where energy matters most:

* Crew meetings
* Chants
* High Rollers
* Morning meetings
* In the field (most important)

Energy determines outcomes.

## Engagement and Culture

From *How to Be a Great Boss*:

* 31.5% of employees are engaged
* 50% are disengaged
* 18.5% are actively disengaged

The question is not *why* this happens—the question is how to change it.

**Answer:** Culture.

> Culture eats strategy for breakfast.

---

## Core Takeaway

Energy, discipline, standards, and integrity create culture.

Culture creates engagement.

Engagement creates performance.

Leaders don’t build culture by being liked.
They build culture by being **respected**.
