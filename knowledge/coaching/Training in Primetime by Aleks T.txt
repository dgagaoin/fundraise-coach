## Purpose of This Talk

This training outlines how to use **Primetime (30–40 minutes)** to dramatically improve a rep’s sales performance by focusing on **technical skill development first**, while simultaneously building confidence and clarity.

The core philosophy: great trainers balance honesty with encouragement and teach people **why systems work**, not just how to repeat them.

## Early Leadership Lesson: Finding the Balance

Aleks shares that early in his career, he experimented with two extremes:

* Being **too nice** → avoided hurting feelings, but failed to show people what needed improvement
* Being **too rigid and strict** → technically correct, but turned people off emotionally

**Both approaches were ineffective.**

Effective training lives in the middle:

* Clear, direct, and corrective
* Supportive, encouraging, and confidence-building

---

## Two Pillars of Primetime Training

There are two core areas of development:

1. **Technical Skills**
2. **Mindset**

This talk focuses specifically on **technical training**, and how powerful it can be when done correctly in the morning primetime session.

---

## The Power of Primetime: A Real Example

Aleks describes a rep practicing an **online rebuttal**:

* Before primetime: **30/100**
* After primetime: **95/100**

Aleks challenged the rep, betting that they would:

* Sign someone up that same day
* Using specifically the **online rebuttal**

The rep did exactly that.

**Lesson:** Proper primetime training can create same-day performance breakthroughs.

## Teach the Basics — Then Diagnose the Gaps

While it’s essential to teach the fundamentals of the pitch, the true skill of a trainer is:

> Identifying *why* someone with a “good pitch” isn’t getting results.

Often, reps are doing **90% correctly**, but a critical **10% is missing**.

Great leaders are excellent at spotting that missing 10%.

---

## Teach the WHY Before the HOW

People must understand the **why** behind the system, not just the mechanics.

Aleks compares this to learning the card game *Uno*:

* You don’t just learn which card to play
* You learn *why* certain cards are played in certain moments

The same applies to sales:

* Why we have the 5 steps
* Why we use specific rebuttals
* Why AIC exists

**Training Prompt:**

> “Can you tell me why we do this?”

* If they answer correctly → reinforce it
* If they don’t → that’s a teaching opportunity

---

## Stories as a Teaching Tool

Stories are the oldest and most effective human learning mechanism.

Aleks shares a story about overhearing a couple speaking Swedish at a restaurant. Though Serbian, he grew up in Sweden and spoke to them in Swedish, instantly creating rapport.

**Key Lesson:**
Rapport is about genuine human connection—not scripts or industry jargon.

---

## From WHY to HOW: Connecting the Dots

Once the *why* is clear, the *how* becomes simple.

**Example: Rapport Building**

* Repeat
* Respond
* Relate

(This is a variation of the classic 3Rs: relax, repeat, relate.)

This dot-connecting approach can be applied to:

* Short stories
* Rebuttals
* Sales systems
* Any part of the pitch

---

## Precision Coaching: Fix the First Major Issue

When training:

* Identify the **first major issue**
* Pause
* Fix it thoroughly

The goal is not to make people feel good—it’s to give them a **great pitch**.

Use constant curiosity:

* “Why did you say that?”
* “Why are you saying this here?”

This keeps reps engaged, thoughtful, and intentional.

---

## Confidence While Correcting

While correcting technique:

* Give credit for effort
* Acknowledge practice and commitment
* Reinforce progress

**Training Structure:**

* Move step-by-step through the 5 steps
* Focus on **no more than 3 main improvements**
* Avoid nitpicking single words excessively

Too many corrections at once kills confidence.

---

## Primetime’s Dual Objective

Primetime is only **30–40 minutes**, but it must accomplish two things:

1. **Sharpen the pitch technically**
2. **Instill confidence for the field**

You want reps thinking:

* ❌ “I hope this works…”
* ✅ “I know this will work if I talk to enough people.”

Example framing:

> “You started here, now you’re here. Take this into the field, talk to 20–30 people, and I guarantee you’ll sign 1–2 today.”

Confidence from the trainer transfers directly to confidence in the field.

---

## Final Example: The ‘Do Enough’ Rebuttal

Aleks shares how fixing a single rebuttal—the **‘Do Enough’ rebuttal**—completely changed his own performance.

Once corrected and understood, he went into the field prepared and performed at a much higher level.

**Small technical fixes create outsized results.**

---

## Core Takeaway

Primetime training works when leaders:

* Teach the *why* before the *how*
* Spot the missing 10%
* Focus on a few key improvements
* Balance correction with confidence

Done correctly, primetime doesn’t just prepare reps—it **activates them**.
