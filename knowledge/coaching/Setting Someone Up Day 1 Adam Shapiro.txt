## Purpose of This Talk

This framework outlines how leaders can intentionally design **Day 1** for a new team member to maximize confidence, clarity, retention, and belief in the opportunity. The first day answers critical psychological questions that determine whether someone stays, grows, or disengages.

The stronger the leader’s self-investment and personal development, the more value they can provide to others. Growth precedes responsibility.

## The 5 Core Components of Day 1

### 1. What Happens in the Office

New people immediately evaluate whether Day 1 matches what was described during the interview and orientation.

**Leader Responsibilities:**

* Guide the new person through everything that is happening
* Explain chants, culture, flow, and logistics
* Show them where things are and what they mean
* Proactively answer questions (even unasked ones)
* Carpool on Day 1 whenever possible—even if inconvenient

**Goal:** Remove uncertainty and reinforce trust.

---

### 2. The Carpool

The carpool sets the emotional and mental tone for the entire day.

**Key Expectations to Set:**

* Prep them for a late day (nothing should be a surprise)
* Clearly define **your responsibility vs. their responsibility**
* Build confidence while setting realistic expectations

**Day 1 Responsibilities for the New Person:**

* Track KPIs for every person who stops and interacts
* Match the leader’s energy as best as possible
* Observe and stay engaged

Tracking KPIs:

* All numbers are combined on Day 1
* This gives them purpose and reduces emotional overwhelm from rejection

**Territory Prep:**

* Explain what type of territory they’ll be in (slow, fast, high-dem, low-dem)
* Prepare them for common objections:

  * “I make too much money”
  * “I’m broke”
  * “I don’t believe in charity”
  * “I don’t have time”

---

### 3. The First Hour

For this model, the new person **shadows only** during the first hour.

**Key Points:**

* They are not expected to pitch yet
* The leader must be highly copyable
* Explain what you are doing and why

(While other approaches exist, this talk emphasizes confidence through observation first.)

## Rule #1: Answer the 3 Questions Everyone Asks on Day 1

Every new person subconsciously asks these three questions. Your job is to answer all of them—intentionally.

### 1. Do I like it?

* Spend **~33% of the day** building a relationship
* Be human, supportive, and present

### 2. Can I make money?

* Spend **~33% of the day** on technical training
* Explain the process out loud
* Break down how sales actually happen

### 3. Is there a future here?

* Spend **~33% of the day** future pacing
* You do NOT need to explain advanced meetings
* Show them what growth and development can look like over time

---

### 4. The Heart of the Day

This is where belief is built.

**Structure:**

* Take turns pitching
* Let them pitch **every other positive interaction**

**Important Guidelines:**

* Do not give them only easy sales
* Do not take all the positive people for yourself
* You must still demonstrate strong positive sales

**Focus:**

* Let them *see* sales
* Highlight everything they do well
* Correct mistakes briefly without dwelling
* Continuously ask what they want to get out of the industry

---

### 5. The End of the Day

End the day logically, not emotionally.

**KPI Review:**

* Show how the day was purely a numbers game
* If numbers were strong, explain why
* If numbers were weak, explain why—using data, not emotion

**Mandatory Reflection Order:**

1. **3 Positives** (always first)
2. **3 Work-Ons** (always last)

This reinforces confidence before critique.

---

## Rule #2: Get With the Right People

Day 1 success isn’t just about the new person—it’s also about the leader.

**Leader Expectations:**

* Communicate with experienced leaders
* Seek feedback and perspective
* Talk with the owner regularly

Strong leaders stay connected, coachable, and aligned.

---

## Core Takeaway

Day 1 is not about perfection—it’s about **clarity, belief, and structure**.

When done correctly, the new person leaves Day 1 understanding:

* What the day looks like
* How money is made
* That rejection is normal
* That growth is possible
* That they are supported
