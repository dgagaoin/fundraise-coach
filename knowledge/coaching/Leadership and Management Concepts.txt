LAWS OF MANAGEMENT
------------------
80/20 Rule:

   *80% of results come from 20% of people


4/3 + 2/3 Rule:

   New FRs will follow 2/3rds of your good habits, but also follow 4/3rds of your bad habits. 
   When training, FRs will always be watching and mirroring us - we should always be mindful
   of getting them up to our good standards, but also avoid displaying bad habits in front 
   of them, because they will amplify those bad habits.


20/60/20 Rule:

   *Top 20% = stars

   *Middle 60% = role players

   *Bottom 20% = move around


Everyone has value

People can change

ROI differs by individual

---------------------------------------------------


Focus Strategy
