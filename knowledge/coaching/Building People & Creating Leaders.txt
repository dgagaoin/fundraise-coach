# Building People & Creating Leaders

## Core Belief

> **“Leaders are not found — they are created.”**

This is a **people business** first. Everything rises and falls on how well we develop people.

## Principles of Building People

1. **Be consistent**
   Consistency builds trust. People don’t follow words — they follow patterns.

2. **Don’t hide — be transparent**
   Openness creates psychological safety and buy-in.

3. **It’s a two-way street**
   Be adaptable. Leadership is not one-directional; feedback matters.

4. **Educate to motivate**
   Understanding creates belief. Belief drives action.

5. **Have a sense of urgency**
   Momentum matters. Urgency without panic creates progress.

6. **Use and abuse others (the right way)**
   You cannot do everything yourself.
   Empower people. Delegate. Build leverage.

7. **Give people the desire to succeed**
   The greatest leaders ignite internal motivation, not external pressure.

## Teaching Through Stories

* Tell **stories with a lesson or meaning**
* Stories:

  * Create emotional connection
  * Make lessons memorable
  * Transfer wisdom faster than instruction

## Why New People Fail (Usually)

Most new people don’t fail because they’re incapable.

They fail due to:

1. **Lack of information**
2. **Lack of attitude**

Both are **leadership responsibilities**.

## The 2/3 – 4/3 Rule: 
   New FRs will follow 2/3rds of your good habits, but also follow 4/3rds of your bad habits. 
   When training, FRs will always be watching and mirroring us - we should always be mindful
   of getting them up to our good standards, but also avoid displaying bad habits in front 
   of them, because they will amplify those bad habits.

* Leaders give more than they take
* Serve before you lead
* Invest in people first — results follow

## Key Leadership Reminder

You are not just running numbers.
You are **building people who build results**.
