## Meaning & Expansion

This quote uses a **craft metaphor** to describe inner development. Polishing requires friction; smoothness is not achieved by avoidance, but by contact.

Rumi is pointing to a spiritual and psychological truth: **growth is inseparable from discomfort**.

---

### Friction as the Teacher

In Rumi’s Sufi worldview, life’s irritations—criticism, conflict, rejection, challenge—are not obstacles. They are *tools*.

If every rub offends us, we reject the very process that refines us.

*Friction reveals where we still cling, resist, or identify too tightly with ego.*

---

### Offense as Ego Feedback

Being “offended” often signals:

* Attachment to self-image
* Fear of inadequacy
* Resistance to change

Rumi doesn’t shame this reaction—he reframes it. Offense becomes **information**, not injury.

---

### Polishing as Becoming

Polishing doesn’t add anything new.
It removes what is unnecessary.

In this sense, the quote aligns with both Eastern philosophy and modern psychology:

* Growth is subtractive, not additive
* Maturity comes from integration, not insulation

---

## Unified Message

**Do not curse the friction—thank it.**

What irritates you is often what is shaping you. Avoiding all discomfort leads not to peace, but stagnation. Transformation requires contact.

---

## Modern Interpretation

In everyday life, this means:

* Feedback is refinement, not attack
* Challenges are training, not punishment
* Emotional resilience is forged, not granted

The person who can endure the rub emerges clearer, steadier, and more whole.
