## “If you broke, you got no business sleeping.”

**Attribution:** *Meek Mill* (Robert Rihmeek Williams)
**Source:** “Dreams and Nightmares (Intro)” (2012)
**Notes on wording:** This line is often quoted exactly as written here; in some recitations it appears alongside an extended sentiment about prioritizing money, discipline, and effort.

---

## Meaning & Expansion

This quote is a blunt statement of **hustle ethics**—the idea that when resources are scarce, urgency must replace comfort.

Meek Mill emerged from environments where financial instability had immediate consequences. In that context, sleep becomes symbolic—not literal rest, but complacency.

---

### Urgency Over Comfort

The line does not argue against rest; it argues against **avoidance**.

To be “sleeping” while broke means:

* Ignoring reality
* Escaping responsibility
* Choosing short‑term comfort over long‑term stability

The quote demands wakefulness—mentally and strategically.

---

### Hunger as a Phase, Not an Identity

Implicit in the line is an assumption: *being broke is temporary if effort is applied.*

This frames hardship as a **season of intensity**, where:

* Focus sharpens
* Priorities narrow
* Action compounds

Sleep returns when stability is earned.

### Discipline in Hip‑Hop Culture

Within hip‑hop, this quote reflects a broader cultural philosophy:

* Delayed gratification
* Relentless work ethic
* Self‑reliance before indulgence

It resonates because it mirrors lived reality for many artists who escaped poverty through persistence rather than privilege.

---

## Unified Message

**Struggle requires alertness.**

When circumstances demand change, comfort is not neutral—it is costly. Progress begins the moment denial ends.

---

## Modern Interpretation

Applied today, this principle supports:

* Early‑stage entrepreneurship
* Skill‑building and career pivots
* Financial recovery periods
* Breaking cycles of stagnation

Balanced wisely, the message becomes: *work intensely when necessary, rest intentionally when earned.*
