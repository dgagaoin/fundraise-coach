IFAW (International Fund For Animal Wellfare)

Problem:

   The reason we’re here today…

   Over 20,000 elephants are slaughtered yearly for ivory

   If nothing changes, they’ll be extinct by 2050

   Horrible, right?

Solution:

   What we do is amazing

   We stop illegal poachers

   Rescue and rehabilitate injured animals

   Release them back into protected land

   U.S. disaster response: reuniting lost pets with families

   Awesome, right?
