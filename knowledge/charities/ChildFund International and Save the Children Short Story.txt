CHILD FUND INTERNATIONAL (Also SAVE THE CHILDREN)

Problem:

   The reason we’re here today…

   Over 15,000 children die every day

   Because they lack basic needs

   Sounds awful, right?

Solution:

   What we do is amazing

   We provide food, water, medicine

   Most importantly, education

   Education breaks the cycle of poverty

   Sounds amazing, right?
