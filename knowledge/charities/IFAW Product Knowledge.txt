## 7) Donation breakdown (program vs overhead)

* **Program Expense Ratio:** **71.86%** (avg of most recent 3 IRS Form 990s, per Charity Navigator). ([charitynavigator.org](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/311594197))
* **Fundraising efficiency (cost to raise $1):** **$0.21** (Charity Navigator). ([charitynavigator.org](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/311594197))
* **Admin vs fundraising split:** Charity Navigator’s public excerpt shows program ratio + fundraising efficiency; it **does not** display a simple “admin% / fundraising%” line in the visible section we can access, so use the two metrics above when talking to donors. ([charitynavigator.org](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/311594197))

---

## 8) Ratings (watchdogs)

* **Charity Navigator:** **99% (Four‑Star)** overall (FY2024 beacon: Accountability & Finance). ([charitynavigator.org](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/311594197))
* **BBB Wise Giving Alliance (Give.org):** Give.org hosts an IFAW charity report page (BBB does not “grade” like stars, it evaluates against standards). The report page is available, but the “meets / not met” conclusion isn’t exposed in the text we can reliably load here. Use Give.org as a reference link for donors who ask. ([give.org](https://give.org/charity-reviews/animal-protection/international-fund-for-animal-welfare-in-washington-dc-9999-2586?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **CharityWatch:** IFAW has a CharityWatch profile page, but **the public view does not show the letter grade / rating details** without membership access. ([charitywatch.org](https://www.charitywatch.org/charities/international-fund-for-animal-welfare-ifaw))

---

## 12) Major positive stories / examples (good for a quick donor story)

* **Disaster response examples** (e.g., emergency transport/relief work with partners like Greater Good Charities). ([ifaw.org](https://www.ifaw.org/news/disaster-response-hurricane-ida-2021?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## 13) Controversies / context (handle carefully if donors bring it up)

* **Malawi elephant translocation (Kasungu, 2022):** IFAW states it worked with partners (incl. Malawi’s DNPW and African Parks) on a translocation of **263 elephants** in mid‑2022. ([ifaw.org](https://www.ifaw.org/press-releases/statement-media-translocation-elephants?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Some media coverage describes **human‑wildlife conflict** and related legal claims after the translocation; IFAW has issued statements responding to the coverage. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/26/charity-faces-legal-action-after-relocated-elephants-that-allegedly-kill-10-people-malawi-zambia-aoe?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

---

## 14) Celebrity endorsements / affiliates

* IFAW’s own public pages emphasize institutional partners and collaborations; **no single “official celebrity ambassador list”** surfaced in the sources pulled for this entry. If you want, I can do a targeted pass specifically for celebrity ambassadors/PSAs and cite only primary/credible sources.

---

## 15) Websites + social

* **Main site:** [https://www.ifaw.org](https://www.ifaw.org) ([ifaw.org](https://www.ifaw.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **International section (alternate path):** [https://www.ifaw.org/international](https://www.ifaw.org/international) ([ifaw.org](https://www.ifaw.org/international/about/programs?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Contact page:** [https://www.ifaw.org/contact](https://www.ifaw.org/contact) ([ifaw.org](https://www.ifaw.org/contact?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Social links are present via IFAW site navigation/headers (platforms include typical channels), but I didn’t pull the exact handles in this pass. If you want handles, I’ll do a quick, exact-handle scrape pass and add them as copy‑paste links.
