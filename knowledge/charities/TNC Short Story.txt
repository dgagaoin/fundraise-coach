TNC (The Nature Conservancy

Problem:

   The reason we’re here today…

   More 27,000 acres of deforestation are happening every day

   As you can imagine, its polluting the air we breath and the water we drink

   What's worse, this is putting more than a million plant and animals species at risk for extinction

   Awful right?

Solution:

   What we do is amazing

   We protect and maintain our forests by clearing up dead brushwood and doing controlled burns

   We plant millions of new native trees every year

   We even clean our oceans and our waterways of pollution 

   Best of all, we buy land for the purpose of protecting and preserving it for our future generations

   Sounds awesome?
