5 STEPS – THE MANUFACTURED CONVERSATION
--------------------------------

1. Intro
   - Get people to the table (ISH) + SEE (Smile, Eye Contact, and Enthusiasm)
   - You can’t sign someone up if no one is there

2. Presentation (Rapport)
   - Sell yourself and introduce the charity
   - People buy people first
   - Find common ground

3. Short Story
   - Sell the charity
   - Present the problem and the solution

4. Close
   - Sell the amount and method
   - Ask for the donation
   - KISS explanation for digital (no cash)

5. Rehash
   - Ask 5 comprehension questions:
     - What is my name?
     - What is the charity?
     - How much and how often?
     - Why are you donating?
     - How long is the commitment?


The manufactured conversation is our systematic approach to getting people to
our event stand, interacting with potential donors, telling them about the 
charity we're representing, and eventually getting a quality sign up. 

It is not a script because we actually want there to be interaction, fluidity,
and back and forth. This is taught on week 1 and is a must know in order
to be properly effective in the field.
