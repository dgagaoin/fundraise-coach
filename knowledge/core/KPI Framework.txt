KPI Framework: How We Measure, Coach, and Stay Calm in the Field
------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are not about pressure or judgment.
They are a logic system that allows reps, leaders, and owners to understand performance, coach effectively, and stay emotionally steady while working the law of averages.

Think of KPIs the same way athletes think about stats — they show where to improve, not who you are.


Our KPI Order (In Field Sequence):

   Approaches

	Any time you said “hi,” waved, smiled, or attempted engagement

	Useful at slower sites; optional at fast sites

   
   Contacts

	People who stopped and had a real interaction

	Asked a question, exchanged names, tried to hand cash, etc.


   Short Stories (Presentations)

	You delivered the Problem + Solution

	This is where impulse is built


   Closes

	You finished the pitch using the close language

	You asked

   Signups

	The result — not the focus

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ideal Daily Ratio (Benchmark):

30 Contacts → 24 Presentations → 12 Closes → 1–4+ Signups

This ratio allows the law of averages to work without emotional overreaction.



How We Use KPIs to Coach and KPI Diagnosis Rules

KPIs tell us where to coach — not whether someone is good or bad.


   If someone has too many closes:

	They may be closing the wrong people

	Not pre-qualifying

	Rushing rapport

	Talking too much, listening too little


   If someone has low contacts:

	They are not giving themselves enough opportunities

	The law of averages cannot work without volume

	They need to work on their intros and ISH

	Mental presence might be an issue

	SEE (Smile, Eye Contact, Enthusiasm) principle and energy on intros

	
	Focus areas:

	ISH reps

	Body language

	Volume & excitement

	Law of averages


   If someone gets contacts but no short stories or closes:

	Confidence gap at engagement

	Pitch not memorized

	Awkward transitions

	Rapport anxiety

	
	Focus areas:

	Welcoming presence

	Immediate rapport

	Smooth transition into the short story

	Comfort with silence and pacing


   If someone presents a lot but closes weakly:

	Short story not emotional enough

	Building too much rapport

	Weak impulse

	Poor AIC or rebuttals



	Focus areas:

	Short story punch

	Emotional stakes

	Clear transition into the ask


   If numbers are near the ideal ratio but signups are still low:

	Advanced issue

	Needs pitch doctoring

	Rebuttals/AIC need tightening

	Owner or senior leader coaching recommended



	ZERO SIGNUPS (ANY CONFIGURATION)

	Problem: Combination day
	Means:

	Tough day + ratios didn’t align

	Focus on controllables, not emotion



	Focus areas:

	Identify biggest limiter via KPIs

	Assign practice, not pressure

Why KPIs Matter:

They keep us calm through rejection

They allow us to trust the system

They remove emotion from feedback

They help leaders coach objectively

They help reps stay confident and consistent

KPIs let us focus on process, knowing the results will follow.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


KPI Coaching Philosophy (Retention-First)

KPIs are not here to judge reps. They are here to keep the game logical, protect attitude, and help leaders coach objectively.

We treat KPIs like stats in sports:

The numbers show where to improve

They keep you calm through “Nos”

They let the law of averages work

Most importantly: when coaching newer reps, we intentionally avoid giving them too many fixes at once. Too many corrections kills confidence and retention.

That’s why our KPI sheets include a reflection section:

New Hire Requirement (bottom of KPI sheet):

3 things I felt I did well today

3 things I will improve tomorrow

Leader/Owner Coaching Standard:

Validate the rep’s wins first (confidence matters)

Identify only 1–2 focus items (not 10)

Use KPI ratios to find the bottleneck and coach it

Keep reps calm and consistent by reminding them: this is a numbers game

KPI Order (Our Field Sequence)

Approaches (optional — useful at slower sites)

Contacts

Presentations / Short Stories (Problem + Solution)

Closes

Signups

Daily Benchmark Ratio (Targets)

30 Contacts → 24 Presentations → 12 Closes → 1–4+ Signups

Signup Performance Tiers

0 signups: can happen; stay calm and keep the ratio
1 signup: solid
2 signups: solid day
3 signups: good day
4+ signups: great day
6+ signups: absolutely amazing
10+ signups: legendary

KPI Meaning for Coaching (Common Bottlenecks)

If Contacts are low (goal ~25–30/day):

Not enough opportunities for the law of averages

Work on intros/ISH quality, volume, excitement, and loud body language to be seen

If Contacts are good but Presentations/Closes are low:

Confidence, memorization, or rapport step issue

If Presentations are high but Closes are low:

Short story not building enough impulse

Rapport timing is off, or they aren’t bridging into the close

If Closes are extremely high:

Can be a red flag (closing wrong people, not prequalifying, rushing, not listening)

If ratios are near-target but signups are low:

Pitch doctoring needed (AIC, rebuttals, confidence, senior coaching)


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Zero Sign-Up Days (Coaching Standard)

Zero signup days happen. They are part of the averages — not a reflection of a rep’s worth or future success.

When a rep zeros out, coaching should follow these rules:

Acknowledge the difficulty honestly (no sugarcoating)

Remove emotion from the numbers

Identify the most likely KPI limiter using ratios:

Low contacts → volume / ISH

Low presentations → engagement / stop power

No closes → transition / ask

High closes, no signups → pre-qualifying

Reinforce effort and mindset if present

Select 1–2 controllable focus items

Assign practice or preparation for tomorrow — not pressure

The goal is to:

protect confidence

keep the game logical

return focus to controllables

improve tomorrow’s odds

KPIs are not a judgment.
They are a coaching tool.
