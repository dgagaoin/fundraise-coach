Quality
-------------


Quality refers to the longevity of a donor. We only sign up donors for their ongoing donation if
they agree to commit to a minimum 1 year of support. 

The average donor who commits to signing up with a face to face fundraiser actually commits on 
average for 3-5 years, which is powerful for the charities we represent. 

Essentially, when charities contract one of our offices for donors we promise them that we will
sign up donors for that minimum 1 year, they pay us a Marketing Service Fee (MSF) for that sign 
up. However since most donors do stick around longer than what they paid for, those ongoing
donations equate to pure profit after that 1st year, going directly to the amazing causes we represent.


There is incentive for Field Reps who sign up donors for more than 1 year. When a Field Rep is around
for at least 6 months, any donors they signed up that are still donating count towards what is called 
a quality bonus. Whenever 75% or more of that Field Reps sign ups, 6 months later, are still enrolled,
each of those donors count towards a $20 bonus (amount can change depending on charity) that is typically
paid out in the middle of the month. 

EG. 

If John Do signed up 41 donors in Jan. In June if 40 of those donors are still donating (97% donor 
retention), they are paid out 40*$20 = $800 on top of what they are already making in commissions
and daily fees. 


This creates a win win for the Field Rep, the Office Owner, and most importantly the Charity.
