TABLET / iPAD WORK & ETIQUETTE
Transition to iPad / Tablet
----------------------------------------

(Assume the sale – Any hard yes = assume the sale)

Anticipated Questions:

“Sure… how does it work?”

“What do I have to do?”

STEP-BY-STEP TRANSITION

1) Start with Gratitude

2) Show State License

Can’t take cash

Not safe for us, could get robbed

Never know where it goes, hard to track

→ We do everything online
→ 2 minute charity form
→ This way you can track & manage your donation

“Let me show you how it works!”

------------------------------------------

RULES OF iPAD
---------------------
1) Silence is deadly

Always build rapport

Crack jokes

2) Explain before asking for information

------------------------------------------

FORM WALKTHROUGH

Page 1 – Build Rapport
----------------------
-First Name

-Last Name

-Profession

-Date of Birth
→ Crack joke: “You sure you’re old enough?”


Page 2
----------------------
-Physical Address:

Means we’re a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit

Fully tax deductible

We send you a receipt

Sometimes free swag (crack joke)


-1st Email Field:

Email is the most cost-effective way for us to reach you

Cuts down on paper / trees

“What's a good email?”


-2nd Email Joke:

“Like I said, it’s $1 a day (or whatever amount)

But it would be ridiculous to bother you every day for $1

So we bundle it monthly or however you wish

But you’re gonna do it for 20 years right?” (just kidding)

“We ask for at least 1 year and then see how it goes, ok?”

-(Unique to each charity)

Page 4 – Payment Details:

-Payment Frequency:

*Monthly – our most budget-friendly option

*Quarterly – a lot of people like this

	Less frequent

	Apparently better for taxes

	Bigger donation chunks

*Annual – big ballers love this

Which one works for you?
(Illusion of choice)


“I can type it in, or you can — up to you”

“I can transfer the payment portion to your phone if you feel more comfortable”

BEFORE SUBMITTING FORM
5 QUESTION REHASH

(Step 5 in the 5 Steps)

“I just have 5 quick questions to keep you safe and make sure I did my job properly.”

1) Do you remember my name?

2) Do you remember the name of the charity?

3) How much and how often are you donating?

4) Why did you want to help out?

5) Like I said, we’re looking for at least:

	1 year of support

	Most people do 3–5 years because they fall in love with our updates and see the impact

	Some people love helping so much they stick around 20+ years or forever

How long do you see yourself helping for?
