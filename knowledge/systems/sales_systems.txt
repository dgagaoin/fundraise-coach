In our organization we utilize acronyms to denominate many of our systems. They each represent a concept 
to apply when a field rep (FR for short) is in the field. They should be applied to all leaders and they 
should as best possible teach these to their teammates in a manner that will benefit their progress and success.

  - You must sip each cup to find the sugar

- Deck of Cards (Process Over Outcome)
  - 52 cards, 4 aces
  - The aces are guaranteed to be there

Important Note:
Every time you lose your attitude and abandon the process,
you throw away a chunk of cards.
The aces could have been there.
