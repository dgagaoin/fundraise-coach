LEADERSHIP SYSTEMS – CORE SLIDES
FUNDRAISE-COACH RAG LIBRARY
==============================

--------------------------------
GET WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE
--------------------------------
Spend more time with the owner or assistant owner.
Learn both the technical and mental sides of the business.

You become like the five people you spend the most time with.
If you want to become a leader in two weeks but spend time
with people thinking like one, you’re in the wrong room.

Spend time with people below you to teach and build confidence.
Spend time with people above you to learn and grow.

--------------------------------
RESPONSIBILITY
--------------------------------
The owner makes more than the high roller because they carry more.

Owners look for key things:
- Belief
- Coachability
- Running a site with 100% responsibility

Your first responsibility is to yourself.
Like on a plane: put your own mask on first.

--------------------------------
ATTITUDE
--------------------------------
Success is 99% attitude and 1% ability.

You can’t control results, but you can control your attitude.
Let your attitude drive your sales.

Think of attitude like a bar:
You need enough for yourself before you can share it with others.

--------------------------------
SYSTEMS OVERVIEW
--------------------------------
Systems include:
- GRASP
- KISS
- GIFTS
- LOA
- SEE
- ISH
- 5 Steps
- 8 Steps
- SHARP
- Rebuttals

Systems only work if you:
- Know them
- Understand them
- Believe in them

They are like a recipe:
If you’re missing ingredients, it won’t turn out right.

--------------------------------
PROFIT
--------------------------------
If you do all the other parts, profit will follow.
Add them all up and you will be successful.

--------------------------------
SENSE OF URGENCY
--------------------------------
Urgency means doing things with purpose.

Parkinson’s Law:
Work expands to fill the time you give it.

Examples:
- Running to open presents
- Being first to the door
- Getting ready quickly

Move with intent.
Same energy as running to open presents.

--------------------------------
HITTING GOALS
--------------------------------
You must set goals before you can hit them.

Small goals build momentum.
Hitting goals becomes a habit.

--------------------------------
ATTITUDE OF NUMBER ONE
--------------------------------
In order to get to number one, you must train like your number two.

Take personal responsibility for everything that happens.
Good or bad — you make it happen.

--------------------------------
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE TEAM
--------------------------------
Whatever your position, you must know what that role requires.

If you’re a high roller:
- Your responsibility is to sell and set pace.

If you’re a team builder:
- Your responsibility is to train, coach, and bring people through.

--------------------------------
PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
--------------------------------
You can’t help others until you help yourself.

Plan your week.
Know what gets measured and what gets done.

Take care of personal matters first so they don’t distract you.

--------------------------------
8 WEEK PLAN – WHY IT HELPS
--------------------------------
An 8-week plan is useful when:
- You don’t have an immediate goal
- You need structure and direction
- You want to maintain momentum

--------------------------------
HOW TO SET UP AN 8 WEEK PLAN
--------------------------------
Start with the end in mind.
Focus on what you want to achieve in 8 weeks and work backwards.

Example:
Week 8: 2 leaders on my team
Week 7: Promote 1st leader, promote 2nd leader, 2 new starts
Week 6: 1 promoted leader, 4 field reps, 2 new starts
Week 5: Promote first leader, 4 field reps, 2 new starts
Week 4: Take best FR on road trip, show how to make $1000/week
Week 3: Teach MTP to FRs, 2 new starts
Week 2: New starts become independent, 1 new start
Week 1: 2 new starts

--------------------------------

--------------------------------
HOW TO FILL OUT A WINELIST

- Total number of people who went in the field

Total Average:
- Total Sales / Total Paid FR Days

Paid Zero Days:

--------------------------------
HOW TO RUN A CREW MEETING
--------------------------------
Crew meetings should be run daily.

Why:
- It’s your team
- It’s your message
- You create culture and following

Crew meetings should be personal:
- Talk about goals
- Talk about dreams
- Share inspiration
- Talk about books you read
- Share promotions and team direction

Length:
- Around 5 minutes
- Too long = people switch off
- Be prepared

Impact:
- Speak from the heart
- Be yourself
- Inspire, teach, or entertain
- Crew meetings are NOT for sales training

Structure:
- Recognition from yesterday/week
- Goal for today/week
- Message

--------------------------------
HOW TO DRAW A “FAMILY TREE”
--------------------------------
Purpose:
To visualize leadership structure and development focus.

Guide:
Square = Leader
Round = Field Representative
Star = Close to leadership

P = Positive trait to reinforce
I = Improvement focus for the week

Example:
Leader:
- Your Name

Direct Reportsを見る:
- Strengths to reinforce
- One improvement to focus on

--------------------------------
HOW TO DO A BREAKEVEN
--------------------------------
Definition:
Breakeven is when total net income equals total expenses.

Why use it:
- Not mandatory
- Helps manage finances
- Reduces pressure
- Gives something specific to work toward

Steps:
1. Add all monthly needs (rent, car, insurance, food, gas, etc.)
2. Calculate base pay after taxes (estimate 75%)
3. Subtract base pay from total needs
4. Determine commission per sale after taxes
5. Divide remaining monthly needs by commission per sale
6. Divide monthly sales by 4 for weekly target

Reminder:
Nobody is motivated by paying bills.
Use breakeven to structure goals for things you enjoy.

--------------------------------
HOW TO RUN AN IMPACT
--------------------------------
Failure to plan is planning to fail.

Preparation:
- Know what you’re going to say
- Know how you’re going to say it

Timing:
- 5–10 minutes
- Optional questions at the end

Structure Option 1:
- Title
- Why it’s important
- When to use it
- Who it applies to
- How to do it

Structure Option 2:
- Intro (what + why)
- 3 main points that lead to success

--------------------------------
PRIMETIME TRAINING
--------------------------------
Primetime is one of the most underutilized tools.

Plan the night or morning before.
Primetime usually lasts 10–20 minutes.

Choose who to work with intentionally:
- Best people
- People you can make the biggest impact on

Pitch Practice:
- Listen to their pitch
- Have them listen to yours
- Repeat
- Identify what they need help with
- Practice the topic

Practice makes perfect.

Good Primetime Topics:
- Stopping techniques
- Building rapport
- Short story
- Close
- Rehash
