Research Rebuttal ("I need to do some research" or "I want to learn more about this")

This also a common rebuttal in high dem areas, and a fundraiser will want to know
solid product knowledge for this to be effective. Also, good rapport that was built
by the fundraiser will help out immensely with this rebuttal.


Smile and Agree:

"I love that you're interested in more about the charity, we all want to be confident
in the causes we support. Most people who want to do research want to know: how much of their
money actually supports the cause versus administration, some history about the charity,
and if we're vetted and rated on Charity Navigator, which do you want to know?


Rebuttal:

Answer all their questions with product knowledge and then the 3 we listed:

"So around (show donation percentage) (%) goes directly to the cause, only (%) goes
to administrative, fundraising, and marketing. We've been around since (give year), And
we're highly rated on Charity Navigator (show page) - it's amazing tool that looks into
all the major charities and how effective their work is, think of it like the Yelp of the 
Charity world. Knowing this, do you think we can get you involved for at least 1 year?"
