Do Enough Rebuttal/Donate to Other Charities ("I do enough" or "I already donate to another charity")

This is a common one in higher demographic areas and will be necessary to know when talking
to more wealthy crowds.


Smile and Agree:

"I love that you're already making a difference, I saw the halo and wings. If you don't mind me
asking, 'what charities do you donate to?' (listen and remember them, even say them out loud),
'how long have you donated to them?' (again listen and remember, and say out loud),
'what originally inspired you to get involved with them? (listen and complement)."


Rebuttal:

"Hey we don't want to take anything away from what you're already doing with your amazing
charities, we want you to keep doing them. What I will say is that (NEW): Nobody is doing this for 
10+ years like what you're already doing for your charities, Everyone is sticking around for at 
least 1 year, because what sets us apart is (Insert USP). Do you think you can find it in your 
heart to squeeze us in for at least year on top of what you're already doing?"
