Corporate Match Rebuttal ("I work for a company that matches my charitable giving") 

You see this alot in larger metropolitan areas, eg. In the bay area, a lot of people work for Apple,
Google, Meta, Nvida, ect. 


Smile and Agree: 

"Thats so awesome that you already give and that your workplace matches your donation. I can tell 
you're the type of person that loves to give in the most impactful way possible. If you don't mind me asking,
who do you work for?" 


Rebuttal:

"So look, I can tell you're a charitable person, what's really cool is we do corporate matching as well! 
We provide you a tax receipt with our EIN that you could take back to your employer and HR department, and
I've known a lot of great corporations to still match your donation. The only major difference is I am
a fulltime fundraiser and I get a ton of credit for my hard work out here. If anything I said inspired you
to want to help out, I'd love to get you involved, it only takes 2 minutes."
