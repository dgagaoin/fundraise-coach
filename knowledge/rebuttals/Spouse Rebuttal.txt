Spouse Rebuttal ("I should to talk to my spouse about this" or "I usually go over charities with my spouse.")

You can see this rebuttal anywhere. As with pretty much all rebuttals, good rapport will
immensely help with converting this. It is important to pay attention to the potential donor
to see if this objection is either a principle ("my wife will kill me if I sign up") or a concern. 
 

Smile and Agree:

"I totally understand! There's a saying, "happy spouse, happy house," I don't want you sleeping on
the couch tonight, just kidding of course. If you don't mind me asking, is this something your
spouse would actually object to?"


Rebuttal:

"So the thing is, (NEW) Nobody is committing to anything long term like 20+ years, Everyone is just 
sticking around with us for at least 1 year, The reason being (Insert USP). Do you think if you went 
home to your spouse tonight and told them we're helping an amazing cause doing (insert cause) for 
at least a year, do you think she would actually mind that you signed up?"
