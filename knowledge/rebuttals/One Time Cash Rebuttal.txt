One Time Rebuttal / Cash Rebuttal ("Can I just do a one time?")

This is our most common rebuttal and getting good at this is essential to having
long term success. Cash donations are a very slight variation. First show the license
and then explain why we can't take cash - 1) not safe because we could get robbed, and
2) you can't track it or know it even got to the charity.


Smile and Agree:

"Thank you so much for even wanting to donate, it means a lot! Just out here,
we're not accepting any one times, can I tell you why?" 


Re-Impulse:

"It's just that one dollar is so much more effective when the charity knows its ongoing.
It helps us plan and budget for how many kids (or animals, trees) we can help, and many resources
we can provide. Plus, (Insert USP)"

Re-Close:

"Like I said, it's just $1 a day, do you think you can find it in your heart to squeeze us
in for at least that first year?"
