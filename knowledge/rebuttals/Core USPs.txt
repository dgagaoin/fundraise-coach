CORE USPs (Unique Selling Points)

ChildFund International (CFI)
  -"We don't just help children, we also help their parents get job training so that they 
    can increase their annual income by up to 20% for the rest of their lives." 
  -"One monthly donor doesn't help just 1 sponsored child, they impact 50+ children in their
    community"


CARE
  -"We don't just help children, we also help women, providing them microloans so they can
   get back on their feet and even start their own businesses in their communities."
  -"We aren't only helping children, we also help prevent early childhood marriages and finding
   alternatives for these families to be more financial secure." 


Save the Children (STC)
  -"We are first responders whenever there's a natural disaster or even incidents of devastation
    caused by war. We also stay during these crisis and are one of the last to leave. Ongoing support
    helps us be ready for any of these situations."
 

IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare)
  -"With 1 year of support, we're better able to equip our rangers with forensic kits and equipment
   to better track down the poachers, and even help animals on the spot whenever they come in harms way."


The Nature Conservancy (TNC)
  -"We don't just work globally, we also do incredible work right here in our state protecting and 
   maintaining some of our conservations (it helps to learn what TNC projects are local in their area
   to use the name in the rebuttal. Eg, Sacramento River in Sac, Mount Hamilton in San Jose). 1 yr
   of support massively helps in keeping it the way nature intended."



IMPORTANT RULE FOR USPs:
- If charity-specific USPs exist in CONTEXT, you MUST use ONLY those.
- Do NOT fall back to Core USPs when charity-specific USPs are present.
- Core USPs are allowed ONLY if no charity-specific USP is found.
- NEVER invent new USPs.
- If no USP exists, say it is missing from the training materials.
