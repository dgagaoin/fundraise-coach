Security Rebuttal ("I don't really want to give out my details or information")

This is an important one to know as this rebuttal is also very common. You'll see it everywhere
but even more so when street pitching.


Smile and Agree:

"I totally understand how you feel! A lot of people we talked to today have felt the same way. We
have found though, that people are still getting involved because..."


Re-Impulse:

"...the store manager (use the store managers name) would never let us be out here if we were 
endangering his/her customers, we also have our license on full display (show license), and
if you are an online shopper like amazon? We use a very similar encryption to them so you 
can feel assured that your details will never be shared with anyone."

*If the charity allows for the payment form to be transferred:

"Plus if it makes you feel more comfortable, we just fill out some basic information, the payment form
I can actually transfer to your phone so I never have to see or touch your card."
