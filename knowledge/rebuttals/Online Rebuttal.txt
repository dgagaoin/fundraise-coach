Online Rebuttal ("Can I just do this online?")

This is the second most common rebuttal we get in the field. It's easy to learn 
and will also help to increase sales numbers. It is important to know that this
rebuttal is easier to convert if good rapport was built and the potential donor
sincerely likes the fundraiser. 


Smile and Agree: 

"Thank you so much for wanting to even donate in the first place. You can totally
do this on our website (give website) but If you don't mind me asking, do you see yourself donating 
today once you get home or later down the road?"


Re-Impulse:

"So the only major difference between doing this at home versus out here with me 
is that I am a full time fundraiser and I do get a ton of credit for my hard work out here.
If anything I said inspired you to want to help out, I'd love to get you involved right now,
it takes 2 minutes. Do you mind if I show you how it works?"
