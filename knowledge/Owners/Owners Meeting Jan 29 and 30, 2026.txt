Michael Scully


3 stories for the day.

Advent of AI, prompt skills. 



"We choose to go to the moon, not because they're easy, but because they're hard." - JFK speech. 1962, Rice University in Texas.

Space Race vs Russians, satellites, Russian in Space Yuri Gagarin, US decided we're going to the moon.

we have not been back to the moon in more than 50 years, Dec 1972.

JFK, we need to get the backing of the American people to get to the moon.



SMART Goals

Specific
Measurable
Achievable
Reason 
Time bound


May 2025, 1961 JFK had the goal of getting to the moon, we got there in July 20, 1969, 8 years.

For context, none of the technology required to go to the moon was not in existence back then. JFK and the US had a SMART goal to get 
to the moon. 

When you want to build something great, you have to get everyone great to do it. Oppenheimer analogy, got the best scientists,
their families, their church into a town to build the Atomic Bomb.

Starfish story (we already have this in the library ;) ) Variation with a young boy instead of an old man picking up the starfish.


-------------------------------------------------

You are probably wrong about test:

In 2026 how many people are living in extreme poverty? People making less than $3/day: 10%

How many people were in extreme poverty in 1980? 40%
How many people were on the planet? around 4 billion
Now there in 2026 there are 8 billion people on the planet. 


It doesn't feel like there's been progress, but there has over the past 50 years - life expectancy is longer, less people starve,
life conditions are better. Its not all perfect, but improvements have been made. 


--------------------------------------------------


Positive Solutions

-It is actually possible to eradicate poverty.


Deep Understanding

- when we were on the moon, the most important image was not the flag, but the image of our planet.



Another story:

Relay race from El Paso Texas to Real Consequences New Mexico. Michael Scully trained for it and participated in it. 

When he was training, he asked, can I run on a treadmill at speed 15 (4 min kilometer), and he couldn't do it. He got to being
able to do it, but couldn't do it at 2km in 4 minutes. He did come to the realization, that he cant run more than 1km/4 minutes
going 100%, however, he could run 30+ kilometers running at 92.3%
