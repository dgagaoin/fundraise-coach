Value - "Think not what your country can do for you, but think what you can do for your country." 
The more value that you put into your business, the more value you get out of it. 


Should owners be in the field - It depends, mostly yes, it depends on what your business needs, and the "Intent". What is the "Result" 
of an owner not being in the field - Interviews? Live and die by the tracker...10% ratio - 10% of interviews will start. 
Events booked? This all goes back to Value for the business.


Reality - of running a business: 

Leaders building a team - if you have less than 5 leaders in the office, you are essentially running a team. Go into the field heavy. 
Monday (Orientation), 3 days in a row in the field, Friday (2nd rounds). Saturday (Field). Also be crew night heavy. 
Ideal recruitment base - 2x the leader base. 

Leaders building a core - 5-10 leaders. Recruiting, heavy 2 days a week.

Running an office - 10 leaders+  Main job is to get recruitment to feed the leaders. 

Ownership is not the finish line, its just the starting line. 


Need an accountability buddy. Its not about being perfect, its about being more good than bad. Have the self reflection to 
understand that I am the problem. More goals. 


Callums answer to the question - should owners be in the field? Technically No. But, Yes no, for No later. It is based on 
the situation. 

"Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die to get there." Do what needs to be done.
