# Setting Expectations

### Jacob Dixon — Ownership, Culture, and Commitment

---

## Core Idea

**Clear expectations create momentum.**

Leaders don’t drift into success — they define outcomes, reverse‑engineer the path, and take ownership of everything required to get there.

---

## Start With the Outcome

### The 3‑Month Question

> **“What do you want to achieve or where do you want to be in three months?”**

* Get the answer
* Break it down
* Reverse‑engineer the steps

Leaders must do this **for their people** and **for themselves**.

---

## Reverse‑Engineer Your Role

Your role changes based on how many people you bring with you into the field:

* **2 people** → Promoting Leader
* **3 people** → Crew Leader
* **Goal state** → Assistant Owner criteria

  * 4 first‑generation leaders
  * 2 second‑generation leaders

Who you bring determines **how you lead**.

---

## Culture Is Built Early

* The **first few people** are your culture creators
* The people you start with won’t always be the ones who help you scale
* Newer people often uphold culture *better* when it’s defined early

### Core People

Core people don’t appear randomly.

They are created by:

* Clear standards
* Consistent performance
* Replicable leadership

Define what a **core leader** looks like:

* Sets standards
* Performs
* Replicates behavior in others

Building core leaders means fewer problems and more self‑policing standards.

## Ownership Is an Identity

Ownership is not a title.

It’s the shift from:

* *“I am an owner”*
  to:
* *“I take ownership of everything that needs to be done.”*

Ask daily:

> **“What moves the needle forward?”**

---

## Commitment to the Outcome

You are responsible for the results you want.

If results aren’t there:

* Fix recruiting and interviews
* Book more sites
* Go out and do sales yourself
* Add extra training nights
* Be present and visible

Commitment requires:

* Action
* Adaptability
* Persistence

Things won’t always go as planned.

Still — do everything in your power to move toward the outcome.

---

## Support Systems Matter

> **90% of companies fail due to lack of support.**

* Use the network
* Ask for help
* Don’t isolate yourself

Jacob’s success came from:

* Leveraging the organization
* Accepting guidance
* Not trying to do everything alone

Support accelerates growth.

## Core Lesson

**Set the expectation. Own the outcome. Build the culture early.**

Leadership is defined by clarity, responsibility, and follow‑through.
