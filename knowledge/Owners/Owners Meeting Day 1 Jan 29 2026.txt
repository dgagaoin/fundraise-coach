Owners Meeting Jan 29 and 30, 2026 Notes
---------------------------------------------

Michael Scully


3 stories for the day.

Advent of AI, prompt skills. 



"We choose to go to the moon, not because they're easy, but because they're hard." - JFK speech. 1962, Rice University in Texas.

Space Race vs Russians, satellites, Russian in Space Yuri Gagarin, US decided we're going to the moon.

we have not been back to the moon in more than 50 years, Dec 1972.

JFK, we need to get the backing of the American people to get to the moon.



SMART Goals

Specific
Measurable
Achievable
Reason 
Time bound


May 2025, 1961 JFK had the goal of getting to the moon, we got there in July 20, 1969, 8 years.

For context, none of the technology required to go to the moon was not in existence back then. JFK and the US had a SMART goal to get 
to the moon. 

When you want to build something great, you have to get everyone great to do it. Oppenheimer analogy, got the best scientists,
their families, their church into a town to build the Atomic Bomb.

-------------------------------------------------

2025: 102,188 donors signed up.  

2026, goals: 130,000 new donors in the US, 170,000 in the UK. 700 trading brand ambassadors (BA also the same as Field rep)
UK onboarding 150-170 new recruits per week.

-30 Trading Marketing Companies (MCs). 
-Currently 40,000 Active donors in Zenterprize (Draw for hope)


-------------------------------------------------


Starfish story (we already have this in the library ;) ) Variation with a young boy instead of an old man picking up the starfish.


-------------------------------------------------

You are probably wrong about test:

In 2026 how many people are living in extreme poverty? People making less than $3/day: 10%

How many people were in extreme poverty in 1980? 40%
How many people were on the planet? around 4 billion
Now there in 2026 there are 8 billion people on the planet. 


It doesn't feel like there's been progress, but there has over the past 50 years - life expectancy is longer, less people starve,
life conditions are better. Its not all perfect, but improvements have been made. 


--------------------------------------------------


Positive Solutions

-It is actually possible to eradicate poverty.


Deep Understanding

- when we were on the moon, the most important image was not the flag, but the image of our planet.



Another story:

Relay race from El Paso Texas to Real Consequences New Mexico. Michael Scully trained for it and participated in it. 

When he was training, he asked, can I run on a treadmill at speed 15 (4 min kilometer), and he couldn't do it. He got to being
able to do it, but couldn't do it at 2km in 4 minutes. He did come to the realization, that he cant run more than 1km/4 minutes
going 100%, however, he could run 30+ kilometers running at 92.3%

Breaking records, and performing at the edge of what's possible (fighter pilot analogy). You cant do this every single day. 

New starts in a week record: 101 (2025) new FRs
New record for new starts: 107 (2026)

Note in headcount and badges 2025, when new owners were promoted out, recruitment slowed down (promoting owners having to replenish their offices, new offices take some time to hit their stride.

Organization is getting more people in, but not retaining as many people as ideal. 

Highest headcount in a day - 386.

*If averages are high, keep recruitment high. If sales are low, you might slow recruitment down to put less pressure on the 
existing leaders. 
*Importance of retention. If letting people go because of performance or culture, thats fine. If people are leaving, then there 
needs to be hard questions asked.


Amazon layoffs - 16,000 soon. Despite the economy, there will always be people to sign up. If the economy is good, we do good, if the economy is bad we still do good (more recruitment). 

Current record of Trading BA's (FRs in field): 523

*30% more (FRs and donors)

"Scoring Aint Boring" - one of the most important things to keep in mind is if someone goes into the field, is if they score. Think 
about the context of what that means - a person came to the office, drove their own car or got transportation, did the morning
sales training and meetings, went to the field for 6+ hours, went back home -> this is a zero to negative net production day for 
that person. Commitment, attitude, skill. Your business is sensitive to the scoring ratio.

*Omar K's question - Firing people. Michael Scully's answer - its never fun, but its never about the one person being fired, its 
about the health of the rest of the team. When to know when to fire someone - it depends. If a person is against the team
values, they should be fired right away. If its a performance thing, then it depends on value alignment - low performer
with values, keep them developing; if they dont have values, not worth keeping around. 



IFAW - 34% Increase in Budget

Feeding Westchester - 1508 donors, 98.54% scoring ratio, 2.48 scoring ratio, 29% non-monthly, 92.84% quality

Save the Children - 13,032, 73.22% scoring ratio, 20.41% Non monthlies, 81% increase in budget

"Suck the oxygen" from other offices

The Nature Conservancy, 12.65% closed reject rate (cancellations before 3 months), 18,000 donors

ChildFund International - 60,000+ new sponsors (x48 = 3 million people impacted), 29% non monthly rate.

Draw For Hope - 20,000 active donors, 37.57% non monthly, 99.50%

ASDF (Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation)

Recruitment



"Some things that don't matter when you're small, really matter when you're big."

Value - "Think not what your country can do for you, but think what you can do for your country." 
The more value that you put into your business, the more value you get out of it. 


Should owners be in the field - It depends, mostly yes, it depends on what your business needs, and the "Intent". What is the "Result" 
of an owner not being in the field - Interviews? Live and die by the tracker...10% ratio - 10% of interviews will start. 
Events booked? This all goes back to Value for the business.


Reality - of running a business: 

Leaders building a team - if you have less than 5 leaders in the office, you are essentially running a team. Go into the field heavy. 
Monday (Orientation), 3 days in a row in the field, Friday (2nd rounds). Saturday (Field). Also be crew night heavy. 
Ideal recruitment base - 2x the leader base. 

Leaders building a core - 5-10 leaders. Recruiting, heavy 2 days a week.

Running an office - 10 leaders+  Main job is to get recruitment to feed the leaders. 

Ownership is not the finish line, its just the starting line. 


Need an accountability buddy. Its not about being perfect, its about being more good than bad. Have the self reflection to 
understand that I am the problem. More goals. 


Callums answer to the question - should owners be in the field? Technically No. But, Yes no, for No later. It is based on 
the situation. 

"Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die to get there." Do what needs to be done.
