# Scoring Ain’t Boring

### Luisa — Performance, Ratios, and Accountability

---

## Core Insight

**Scoring ratio matters more than headcount.**

Two offices illustrate the point:

* **40 people** at **50% scoring**, 1.5 avg → **30 sales**
* **30 people** at **75% scoring**, 1.5 avg → **36 sales**

More people in the field does not guarantee more results.

Higher ratios outperform higher volume.

---

## Performance Philosophy

Great offices manage performance on **two levels**:

1. Collective (the team as a system)
2. Individual (the person as a performer)

Both must be addressed simultaneously.

---

## Collective Performance Management

### 1. Recognition

* Public recognition in meetings
* Reinforce winning behavior

### 2. Winelist Analysis

* Identify individuals pulling overall performance down
* Removing the wrong people can raise team numbers

> *“It is easier to give birth than to resurrect the dead.”*

Leaders must learn to interpret their winelist honestly.

### 3. Sales Impacts

* Focus on technical skill development
* Better skills = more money for reps and charities

### 4. Masterclass Training

* Structured, high-level training sessions
* Raise the standard across the entire office

### 5. Clear Expectations

* Expectations build people up
* Training prepares people to perform

---

## Individual Performance Management

### 1. Expectations Sheets

* Set clear standards from day one
* Remove ambiguity for new reps

### 2. Incentives & Bonuses

* Reinforce performance behavior
* Reward consistency and growth

### 3. Hire Fast, Fire Fast

* Do not lower standards to protect feelings
* Keeping the wrong people hurts the team

---

### 4. One-to-Ones

* Target: **8–10 per week**
* Focus on bell-ringing performance
* Diagnose early:

  * Skillset issue?
  * Mindset issue?

> *“You can bring a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.”*

---

### 5. KPIs & Live Coaching

* Use KPIs to evaluate performance
* Make phone calls throughout the day:

  * Reinforce when reps are doing well
  * Intervene quickly when they’re not

### 6. Leader Accountability

* Leaders must be held accountable for results
* Performance issues should not linger

---

## Systems & Intervention

High-performing offices win because they have:

* Better systems
* Faster interventions
* Higher standards

---

## Core Lesson

**Scoring isn’t boring — it’s the foundation of growth, morale, and impact.**

Ratios tell the truth.

Standards protect the team.

Action drives results.
