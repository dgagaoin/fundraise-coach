# Engagement, Money, and Being a Great Boss

### Michael Scully — Lessons from *How to Be a Great Boss* and Personal Finance

## Core Idea 

Great leadership and long-term success come down to **engagement** and **discipline** — with people *and* with money.

## Engagement Is the Multiplier

Drawing from *How to Be a Great Boss* by **Gino Wickman** and **René Boer**:

* Engagement is the key driver of performance
* People who **like their job** work on average **9 more hours per week** than those who don’t
* Enjoyment → engagement → productivity

Leaders don’t extract effort.

They **create environments people want to show up for**.

## Money, Lifestyle, and Reality

Making more money does not automatically mean building wealth.

### Lifestyle Creep

* If spending rises faster than income, wealth disappears
* Downgrading lifestyle is psychologically difficult
* Financial stress is one of the leading causes of divorce

As a business owner, it’s easy to:

* Outperform your income
* And *still* outrun your spending

Discipline matters.

## Keep Lifestyle Lean, Invest the Difference

* Keep personal expenses controlled
* Use surplus income to invest in assets
* Assets work even while you’re sleeping

### Real Estate Example

* Buying a home
* Renting it out
* Letting long-term appreciation and cash flow compound

Running a business + controlled lifestyle = leverage.

## Investing Fundamentals (Simple > Fancy)

### Rule of 72

Estimate how long it takes to double your money:

**Years to double = 72 ÷ annual rate of return**

Example:

* 6% return → ~12 years
* 8% return → ~9 years

---

## Timing the Market vs Time in the Market

* Buy when prices are low
* You only know what’s “low” by watching consistently

### Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)

* Invest a fixed amount at regular intervals
* Example: $100/month vs $1,200 all at once
* Removes emotion and guesswork

**ABB: Always Be Buying**
