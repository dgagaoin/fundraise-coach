## Core Ethos

> **“Every day I run my company, my responsibility is to replace myself.”**

* Leaders are always being watched
* Leaders must always be watching for future leaders
* Everything you do gets **magnified or reduced** through your team

### The 2/3 – 4/3 Rule

* People copy **2/3 of your good habits**
* People copy **4/3 of your bad habits**

Leadership behavior compounds—good or bad.

## People Strategy

### A, B, and C Players

* **A Players**:

  * Self‑motivated
  * High self‑esteem
  * Intrinsically driven
  * Operate with a *“with me or without me, I will succeed”* mindset
* You will always have B and C players
* Better people = easier company to manage

### The 80/20 Principle

* 20% of people drive 80% of results
* 20% of people drive 80% of culture
* Focus leadership energy on developing and retaining the top 20%

---

## Training & Performance

### Train Like It’s Game Day

* Top athletes train like every day is the **Super Bowl**
* Training intensity dictates field performance
* **90–120 minutes of training** sets the tone for **6–8 hours in the field**

### Practical Application

* Training must be intentional
* Impacts should have strategy, not repetition for repetition’s sake
* Coaching must focus on mechanics
* Adjust for:

  * Territory
  * Demographics
  * Audience differences

### Learning by Proximity

* You don’t need everyone practicing
* **90% learn from the top 10%**
* Be in the room with the best performers

---

## Morning Meetings & Mindset

* Motivation affects the **subconscious**, not just conscious thought
* Subconscious focus creates belief systems (credit: Tony Robbins)
* Stories shift internal dialogue
* High morale → high performance

### Storytelling as Leadership

* Great storytellers create belief
* Belief creates buy‑in
* Buy‑in creates performance

---

## Accountability & One‑to‑Ones

* One‑to‑ones are non‑negotiable
* People don’t leave because leaders challenge them
* People leave because they’re not making enough money

### Leadership Truths

* You don’t need people to like you
* You **do** need people to respect you
* Everyone—including top performers—must be challenged

> **“If I don’t challenge people, what is the point of me being here?”**

Great coaches keep people sharp.
Pressure, when applied correctly, builds performance.

---

## Self‑Reflection & Data

* Ask:

  * *What do I see in the mirror?*
  * *Are my results a reflection of that?*
* Data and KPIs are king
* Inner instinct matters, but must be paired with data

---

## Ownership & Scale

* Assistant Owner / Partner years are harder than ownership
* Leadership training starts **before** ownership
* Bigger business = bigger pressure
* Leaders must handle pressure—and apply it appropriately

### Building Owners

* One strong office can produce **15+ owners**
* Standards must remain high
* Mental readiness is as important as skill

---

## Recruiting & Storytelling

* The better storyteller you are, the better recruiter you become
* Study:

  * Books
  * Podcasts
  * Public speakers
  * Stand‑up comedians
* Authenticity matters more than polish

---

## Financial Discipline

* Better money management = more freedom
* Keep operations lean
* Discipline early compounds later
* Mentorship accelerates learning

---

## Closing Ethos

> **“If you walk into my company, I owe you the best possible training and opportunity.”**

Leadership is built on:

* Training
* Focus
* Mindset
* Stories

## Q&A Highlights

**On timelines to ownership:**
It doesn’t matter how long the climb takes—the view at the top is the same.

**On pushback to pressure:**
If it’s not a big deal now, will it matter later? Challenge with logic, not emotion.

**On money management:**
Spend less, need less, stay lean. Discipline matters.

**On accountability:**
You must hold yourself accountable before holding others accountable.

**On storytelling confidence:**
Study great performers. Practice delivery. Speak from the heart. Authentic stories carry energy.
