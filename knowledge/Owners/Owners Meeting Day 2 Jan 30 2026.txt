Owners Meeting Day 2, Jan 30, 2026


OmarK's topic (Recruiting)

1) What is my company's story - "I want people to feel like they're in the number 1 place."

   Even with a small team, the goal is to get to 30+ people. The goal is to give people an opportunity and 
   people on the team need to understand and feel that.

   - Starts with the AD. On Indeed don't use the customer service style. Use a fundraiser representative ad.

   - The system in place. During interviews be with very very direct. Mention the base pay, face to face fundraising,
     opportunity.

   - The phone call. The expectation, every admin should be doing 100-150 calls per day, booking in 30 people.
     120 applicants on the Ad, this might need multiple admins. Every applicant should be getting 3 calls. 

     * I saw your application, are you still looking for the job...(booking phone call) very direct. It is a sales
       company, but we only work with charities etc.. Spell it out and say exactly what we do - set up a trade booth,
       interact with people. Don't use the word "events" - instead we partner up with business stores and interact
       with the general public. People who come in have a very clear understanding of what we actually do.
     * 1st rounds in Person. 2nd rounds in person. Individual interviews, 1 on 1 for first rounds. 2nd rounds are
       groups.

   - In the emails, there are clear directions as to where the office is. Not just directions, pictures of where to
     go so that they have a visual. 

   - In the interviews there are pastries and coffee; you want to be personable with the people coming in. 

   - How first rounds are done: 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 max.

       1) Introductions - expectations and why we're recruiting, its how we get to know you, how you get to know us.
	     10-15 minutes. 2nd rounds are longer - 45 minutes.

           Why we're recruiting, expansion - goal to get to the office to 60 people so that when we send people out
             the office is still healthy and staffed. (Never worry too much if talking about expansion is too much,
             its good for social proof, but still the potential new start cares more about what's in it for them). 
      
           Be very clear about the hours and the commute (build rapport here).


       2) Body - either build rapport or move on. Depends on how rapport went in introductions.

  	    What are you looking for? Usually 5 things - job stability, opportunity, growth, 

 	    About Us - go over what was said in the phone call, but expand more on it. Direct marketing vs Indirect 
		(Instagram example). Then what we do, partner with groceries stores, pet stores, spots where we 
		can do face to face. Use apple example - biggest tech company, but they still have apple stores
		and still do face to face sales. *note during the interview be personable and relatable - anime,
		sports, cars - have those memorabilia in there. Always be in control of the rapport (can use 
		time 15 minutes to keep control). Keep red flags in mind - not professional, bad mouthing previous
		company, trauma dumping. Can use, "hey we have everything we need, we'll reach out if we decide to
		offer you the position.

	    Pay structure - commission and performance based, plus low base pay. Be very up front - in the original 
		Ad as well as the 1st round. Just raising awareness is not the goal, it is to sign people up. We incentivize 			performance over time. Ask "why do you think you'll be successful here given that it is commission and
		performance based. Can explain 3 different ways of getting paid - hourly, salary, commission, we do 
		fall under commission obviously, being a sales company. Can explain out the average of the company.
		"Topping up" is just explained as a base pay. 

      3) Wrap Up - recap. If you decide to hire someone, offer to bring them back on the spot, if not, tell them 
		you have more interviews to go over and then we'll reach back out to them at the end of the day. Give
		them a paper that gives them something to do that has some of the questions that will be asked - it 
		helps them pre-think about it before they get to the interview - set them up to give you a better 
		interview. Put the time for the 2nd rounds on the paper. If there's a time number, you are bringing them
		back for the 2nd round, if there's no time number, you're not gonna bring them back. Be careful to not
		make it sound like you're giving the job just yet. Admins prep people and are told to dress sharp. 



   - 2nd Round Interviews: Do big groups. Have zero confusion as to what is going on. No events, no need to sell the idea
		any more. Start with people having the final evaluation forms - the last things we look at when we decide
		who gets the job. Go over route to market, then get them to answer the question on the paper. You get
		to see who has the best answers and who wants to volunteer to speak. Get people to talk, but everyone
		gets to answer on paper, the most confident ones speak up. Admins can call at the end of the day! Finish
		the second rounds with expectations. "This is what's gonna happen next...this is what's gonna happen next..."


   - Things to avoid: No customer service ad on indeed (do a sales representative or fundraiser ad). Do not use the word
		events. We have trade booths. Look at it as I love what we do - give that energy and vibe to others.

Michael Scully

	Always have a powerful story to tell. Sell people on 'you'.  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Bouncing Back (The Renewal) by Sarah Kim

	Started with 6 people, 2 piece average. Early momentum was not maintained for long term stability. 
	Problems with team culture, admin was terrible at recruiting. Knew needed to make changes to her team
	but didn't because she didn't want to 'hurt' peoples feelings. Had a hard time having tough conversations.
	Started blaming the territory. Business paid the price for all of the mistakes. Had to relearn lessons
	in from the field. "Results should not dictate attitude, Attitude should dictate results." Became reactive
	and lost confidence, and lost faith in the opportunity. 

	"Stop feeling bad for the wrong people." -Michael Scully, "you should be feeling bad for yourself, your
	business, and the people you haven't even hired yet." Misplaced compassion can severely hurt, until you
	learn to lay down the law. Don't let other people control your business. "Some fires aren't there to destroy,
	their there to clear dead growth and create space for new growth." There are necessary clearings and changes.
	"Doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity." 
	-Albert Einstein. Avoid building a victim and scarcity mindset. Just hold yourself accountable. Don't
	let your feelings run your business. 

	Rebuilding ('Ahah' moments)

	-Resolve to not fail this.
	-Resolve to not give up.
	-Make success a need not a want.
	-Don't protect feelings, protect the business.
	-Don't generalize the entire team, look at individuals.
	-People are going to talk badly about you because you are the boss.
	-The job is to recruit, to train, to set the standards, expect BS to happen, to work on yourself, have fun doing it.
	-Law of averages with Admins, recruitment and team members. People can matter in the moment even if they don't stay
	 long term. 
	-I just takes 2 weeks to turn things around.
	-You don't need to feel confident at first, you just need to act first. Motion creates emotion. 

	Reinforcing
	-Stop worrying about head count, low performers
	-The right people will understand why standards exist, why tough conversations matter, why accountability matters.
	-She just got better and with more clarity and proper leadership. 

	"Forests might not look great after a fire, but roots are still growing under the surface."


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



	Scoring Ain't Boring - Luisa

	2 offices: 
	- 40 people, 50% scoring ratio 1.5 average - 30 sales
	- 30 ppl 75%, 1.5 avg - 36 sales 

	Difference between more guys in field and less ratio vs less guys higher ratio. Higher scoring ratio is more important

	Managing performance - Collective vs Individual

	Collective: 
	- In meetings - recognition.
	- Winelist - is there someone taking away from the general performance of the team? Jacob fired 2 girls and in turn
	  that brought up the numbers of the entire team. "It is easier to give birth than to resurrect the dead." 
	  Teach leaders to interpret their own winelists.  
	- Sales impacts - help the technical skills of the team, help them make more money for themselves and the charities.
	- Master class training sessions. 
	- Setting proper expectations. The goal is to build people up, train people up to be able to perform. 

	Individual:	
	- Expectations sheets with new people on the team. 
	- Bonuses and incentives
	- Hire Quick, Fire Quick. Don't lower the standards so that it hurts the team.
	- 1 on 1 meetings. Goal 8-10 a week. Expectations is to ring bells. 
	- Figure out right away is it skillset or mindset? You can bring a horse to water but you can't make them drink it.
	- KPIs - evaluate people's performance. 
	- Phone calls throughout the day - when they're doing well and when they're not doing well. 
	- Hold Leaders accountable. 

	
	Have better systems, faster interventions.

	Running a Great Sales and Marketing Business - Ali Mir (Runs the UK BriteVox)

	-800 brand ambassadors the UK

	-Ethos - Everyday I run my marketing company, my role and responsibility is to replace myself. I am constantly
	 under watch by the people who come into my business, and I am constantly watching the people in my business
	 for those who can replace me. 

	-Everything you do will be either magnified or reduced down. Remember the 2/3rds and 4/3rds rule - people will copy
	 2/3rds of your good habits, and 4/3rds of your bad habits.
	-Mission is to recruit A players, but you will always get B and C players. A players are individuals that operate
	 with their own initiative, have self esteem, and have motivation that is intrinsic. They can inspire other people
	 and drive other people. Embody, "With me or without me" I will succeed.
	-How this relates to managing a company - if you have better people, it will be easier to manage your company
	-80/20 rule. 80% of your results will come from 20% of your people. Or 20% of your people will drive 80% of your
	 culture and performance. Drive the top 20%
	-Getting guys scoring and being better at fundraising - there's a common theme among top performers in sports - 
	 training days need to be like it's the "Superbowl" , the big game. Tom Brady and Jerry Rice trained like this. 
	 The 2 hours of training dictate the 6-8 hours in the field. How you run this 90 minutes or 2 hour training; the 
	 intensity and the mindset follow through into the field. Get people into that right space of intensity and mindset.
	 *what does this mean in layman's terms? Are people just running practice and impacts just for running them or is 
	  there a strategy in place? Is an impact run with thought and intention? If the strategy always the same and no
	  thought put into it, then bad results can follow. How good is the sales coaching? Focus on the mechanics. 
	-Keep in mind how do you operate in different territories, demographics, and with different people.
	-Be in the room with the best people. When the best people are running impacts, practice what they are speaking on.
	-You actually don't need to get every single individual practicing, 90% will learn from the 10% of the best performers
	 who do practice.  
	-Morning meetings - motivation is critical. But the other part to it is focus - which is subconscious, not conscious.
	 That subconscious focus creates a feeling and a belief system within the person (credit to Tony Robbins). The
	 subconscious focus might have negatives that people are operating on without even know. Subconscious focus is changed
	 when people are given things to think about, motivation, stories, to change their internal focus and messaging
	 to something beneficial. A great morning meeting speaks to the subconscious. If morale is high, performance is high.
	 Be a good story teller - your ability to be a great story teller can dictate how many people will follow you, how
	 many people will buy into you. 
	-Focus on how amazing this is. You don't have to be great to start, but you have to develop it. How to challenge AND
	 motivate people with a smile on your face. 
	-What do you do to keep people accountable and performing? One to ones - don't be scared of challenging people. 
	 No one leaves because you're tough on people or challenging people if it is coming from a good place. People do 
	 leave because they aren't making as much money as they want to. The only way to counter this is to have the ability
	 to have these one to one conversations.
	-Keep in mind that you're not looking for friends, if that happens great, but you are here to look for winners and 
	 to have an impact on people's lives. If you feel someone is walking through the business and not performing to their
	 potential, then you need to have those one to ones. You don't need people to like you, but you do need them to 
	 respect you. Don't be scared of challenging people, even the top performers, everyone needs to be challenged to be
	 successful. "If I don't challenge people, then what is the point of me being here? That is part of the role."
	 You are there to build high performers. The ultimate thing you're trying to get to, is to get someone's 
	 conscious to hold themselves accountable. Great coaches keep people on their toes. Having the nerves is a good thing,
	 that helps you perform to the high level that you can. 
	-What do you see in the mirror when you look at yourself? Is it a winner? Are the results you get a reflection of this 
	 as well. 
	-Being able to look someone straight in the eye and being able to say, "I'm being frank, but I think you can be better."
	 Look at the data and the KPIs - data is king. Inner instinct should also be tuned into in order to have these one to one's
	 with people. 
	
	-Learn to sit with the business owner and discuss how the business is going (in the US you can do it in the morning since
	 we don't come back to the office at the end of the day). You need to prep, think through, and discuss the entire team. 
 	 the more people involved in doing this, the
	-Your time as a business partner or Assistant Owner should be tougher than your time as a business owner. "You
	 can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect the dots after time has passed" - Steve Jobs. The 
	 training for running an office doesn't start as a business partner/assistant owner, it starts when you're a leader.
	 The bigger your business, the bigger the pressure. You have to be able to handle the pressure. You have to be able to 
	 put people under a good amount of pressure. 
	-Then training comes for recruitment, finance, running the admin team, and the backend. 
	-1 office can produce 15+ owners when things are done right. Be demanding of these standards. 
	-Part of the job is to impart the skills and make people mentally ready. Fix problems with potential individuals before
	 sending them out.
	-You also have to be a great recruiter. Its about - the better you are at in telling a story, the better recruiter you
	 can be. Read, listen to podcasts, and you'll be able to tell stories that are relevant. There are levels to this,
	 but you can get better at this with constant practice.

	-Finances - the better money manager you are the more money you'll have. Study the financial aspects of the company. 
	
	-Recap - remember the ethos - if you walk into my company, I owe it to you to give you the best possible training and 
	 opportunity for you. In order to this, I also need to create stories with myself, the office, and the people in it. 
	 It all comes down to the training, the focus, and the mindset. 

	-Question from Callum - How do you deal with people that want to get to ownership in 12 months, lose their momentum
	 when they don't achieve it? Answer from Ali, "It doesn't matter how long it takes to get to the top of the mountain,
	 the view from the top is still there once you get their. What race are we in to change your life? Does it matter 
	 how long it takes to get there?"
	-Question from Jade - You need to frequently put pressure on people if you want them to succeed...how do you deal
	 with pushback from people even though you've expressed that you're doing putting the pressure to help them? Eg.
	 core person might not do things systematically with their team, e.g. "I didn't think it wasn't a big deal?" 
	 Answer, "well if it isn't a big deal now, is it going to be a big deal tomorrow...will it matter to your future
	 if it's a big deal." You don't need to be angry, you just need to beat them intellectually and with logic. 
	 "If it's not a big deal, what is a big deal?" Come from a place of I'm here to make you better.
	-Question from Omar - "What do you recommend a new owner learn about money management?" Answer, "the more money 
	 you have, remember the leaner you can keep things, the less you spend, and the less you need, if you can 
	 keep this principle early on, this will help immensely." Also, the best thing you can have is a mentor! IN
	 finance you just really need to learn discipline. 
	-Question from Lacey - "How do you better challenge people with holding themselves accountable?" Answer, the
	 key is consistency and not being scared of asking the right questions. You have to hold yourself accountable
	 in order to hold others accountable. Use the, "what do you see in the mirror?" conversation. The answer will be 
	 different for different people. "If you're gonna be tired anyway, you might as well be tired and successful instead
	 of tired and broke." Always talk about being a winner, and the characteristics of winner. Also talk about the fact 
	 that you are a winner. 
	-Question from Tali - "How do you get better at story telling if you're not confident at story telling." Answer,
	 watch stand up comedians - Richard Pryor, Dave Chapelle, etc. Watch great public speakers, politicians (JFK, Obama),
	 take story telling courses, Masterclass. Be authentic. The key is in the delivery and the feeling. The connection 
	 and the transfer of energy. How people can make people laugh, and how people can make people feel good. The 
	 best stories come from the heart and are authentic.

	Setting Expectations - Jacob Dixon

	-"What do you want to achieve or where do you want to be in 3 months?" Break it down for them, and reverse 
	 engineer their goal.
	-Reverse engineer your own goals. What do you want to build with the leader base. Remember, when you do
	 go out to your city, the number of people you bring with you determines what role you are acting from:
	 3 people, you are essentially a crew leader, 2 people you are a promoting leader; your goal is to get back 
	 to assistant owner criteria - 4 1st gen leaders, and 2 2nd gen leaders. 
	-Create the culture - the first few people are your culture creators. The reality to keep in mind, the people
	 you start with won't always help you scale properly, it's the newer people that you bring on that uphold the 
	 culture. Focus in on building core people from the beginning. Core people don't show up out of nowhere, you
	 have to create the culture early on for them. Define what a core leader looks like - the ones who have standards,
	 perform, and can replicate that from there. Building core leaders = more people setting the standard for you.
	-Ownership isn't just a title, it's an identity. It's the difference between saying "I am an owner" to "I am 
	 taking ownership of everything that needs to be done." Ask the question, what moves the needle forward. 
	-Commitment to the Outcome - if you aren't happy with the recruiting and interview numbers, spend the time fixing it.
	 If you're not happy with the amount of sites, spend the time booking more. If you aren't happy with the overall
	 sales numbers, go out and do sales. You are in charge of the outcome that you want. Set up extra training nights
	 if needed, and be there yourself. Be adaptable with the commitment as well. You have to be ok with change and things
	 not going the way you expect them. However do everything in your power to work towards the goal you are committed to.
	-Support system - the 90% of companies that fail, fail because of a lack of support. There is a great network here 
	 in this organization, utilize the network for help. Jacob's success came because he had the support and help
	 of the network, and not shying away from asking for help.

	What I Learned Opening 3 Marketing Companies in 1 Year - Carlos U

	-Things learned in the process of helping others open up their business. 
	-Build confidence through structure. If we're gonna do something, we have to do it right. Reinforce the
	 2/3rds 4/3rds rule - remember it for yourself and how people are watching you. 
	-What is unshakeable confidence? Sticking true to your word. Because you trust what you say. A lot of 
	 people understand the structure - leaders meeting, primetime, sales impact, morning meeting, teams, customer
	 service, high rollers, 1 on 1s, winelists, interviews, orientation day, pre-management meeting, super Saturdays.
	 You need to build confidence in knowing how and why we do this - assistant owners and business partners need 
	 to watch all of this - they need to spend time doing this, alongside letting them still hit the field. 3 days in
	 the office, 2 days in the field, or 2 days in the office, 3 days in the field; after office time, still hit the 
	 field. If you have less time in the field, you do still have to be more intense in the field. 
	-Teach people how to handle those 1 on 1s. Have them do the sales impacts, leaders meetings, morning meetings,
	 Booking interviews, booking events, have them learn to do it all. Do this for 3 months every single week. You will
	 work really hard, but by working really hard on these things, the work becomes easier. 
	-Everyone is different. But lean into their strengths, and remove things along the way that can hold them back. Find
	 their weaknesses and help them work on them.
	-What Would I have done differently? More preparation, going over recruitment goals better, going over the data better,
	 managing the administrator and the winelists, balance sheets. Having a bigger roster after sending people out for 
	 their promotions - build more 1st gens before sending people out. More crew nights with newer people. Go out on 
	 road trips as an owner (4-5 a year) - this helps develop people along the way. Better KPI tracking. Knowing that
	 even if you're operating well, there's still always areas to improve and work on. 
	-Teach people the characteristics of how to be a top performer.

	Michael Scully - Book, "How to Be A Great Boss" by Gino Wickman and Rene Boer.

	Excerpt main point - engagement is the key. People who liked their job on average worked 9 hours more a week than
	those who didn't. Engagement and enjoyment equates to more productivity.

	When making money, you might not always be "rich" if your dollar spending is more than you make. 
	"Lifestyle creep" for money management is important to think about. Its hard to downgrade after you upgrade. 
	Finances go wrong is one of the biggest reasons for divorce. People can easily outperform your spending burn rate
	as an business owner. If you keep your spending lean, and have surplus in money, one of the best things you can do
	is invest in assets. 

	The benefits of buying a house, and then renting it out. Long term investment grows. Running a business while 	
	keeping your lifestyle costs down can enable you to make investments that can make you even more money, even 
	when you and your loved ones are sleeping. 

	Rule of 72 in investing: How long will it take to double my money? Take your rate of return and then divide it by
	by 72.  Formula: Years to double = 72/annual rate of return. Most annual rates of interest are 5-10%

	When should you buy in the stock market? When it's low. How do you know when a stock is low? You have to watch it.
	Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy of investing a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals. Eg. 
	$100 a month for 12 months versus $1200 all at once. DCA helps you not have to think about it. ABB - Always Be
	Buying. 

	Michael Scully's philosophy - stick to boring shit. Keep it simple. Example buying of Vanguard ETF (VOO).

	Long story short, with owner money, invest your money and grow it, don't blow it on stupid shit. On investing,
	Michael Scully read a book, if you're dumb and don't want to think about it, just DCA invest every month.

	Understand Roth IRAs as well.

	Building From Scratch by Nader K

	-The importance of not comparing, especially when starting out. "The business doesn't scale before I do." 
	Showing up however good or bad has a huge effect on the team. The office is twice the energy you bring - both
	ways - good energy, office has 2x energy, if low energy, the office has 2x less energy. 
	-Consistency matters way more than strategy. Preparation and being planned and organized is what builds confidence 
	when you're new. Be consistent even when you have a smaller office, and never think, "I'll do these things
	when I have a bigger a office. 
	-The importance of emotional control. On the outside never show emotional unevenness; make everything logical and
	solution oriented. The reason, you can't add onto other peoples emotional swings. 
	-Clarity beats motivation. The reality is a lot of people just lack an understanding. You can avoid this by setting
	proper expectations - this makes people comfortable as people don't like being in the unknown. Clear expectations
	helps with retention. People will stay broke forever, but they will not stay confused. 
	-Culture before results. "Take notes take notes" , "Sense of urgency, sense of urgency." Care more about culture
	than sales or results. High sales bad culture is a short term return but bad long term value. "If you bring someone
	in, and you let them go, and they don't know why...that is bad for culture." The behaviors we set in the beginning
	will have a long term impact good or bad. Good example, time keeping. Letting 8:31, 1 minute late slip by...can 
	actually be horrible long term. 
	-What approach do you take angry, disappointed, understanding, can vary, but how you address it is what is important. 
	-Retention is a leadership problem not Recruitment. Fix the problems you have now, before adding more people and 
	having a bigger team. Recruiting more will not fix the problem, leadership culture will. People will stay when 
	they feel developed. 
	-Proof can't be built first. Waiting for results to have a story kills momentum. Shout out any positives that you 
	can find. This helps reinforce that the small stuff matters and the recognition builds belief and confidence before
	the numbers ever can. Structure created comfort and trust. People commit to the direction before the outcome. Get
	creative and take risks. Small offices are only small in the beginning, they're not behind, they're just small.

	Question from Michael Scully to Nader - How to manage people's expectations when the team is small? Nader - keep 
	talking big about the goals.

	Staying Confident - Adam Shapiro

	-Remembers the old "Coffee shop" interviews where we would take potential new hires to coffee shops for their
	 interviews. Back then we would ask, "If I told you, you would make $500 a week but in 2 years you could be running
	 a marketing and sales office and make $150K+ a year, would you take that opportunity?"
	-Personal story of being an owner where things aren't going the way you expected when watching other owners succeeding.
	-How do you resist the negative thoughts that creep up in this situation? Student Mentality.
	-The Motive, The Network, The Forecast. You can't just be a good student and learn a lot, you have to actually
	 go out and apply the learned knowledge. Recognize the bad decisions that you were making. 
	-Read book, "The Motive" by Patrick Lencioni. Why do we keep making the same bad decisions - some people when they get to 	 somewhere, they think they have the right to go and do whatever they want - but this doesn't always lead to good actions, 	 decisions, and then bad results. NFL analogy - players that get drafted and then relax, vs players that get drafted and 	 realize this is just a starting point. Same for becoming a new owner. Never stop looking for the answer, eventually
	 you are going to figure it out. 
	-The Network. Being afraid to use it, people resist just reaching out, due to any number of reasons, "I already know 
	 what they're going to say..." "I don't want the spotlight on me when I'm doing bad" "I don't want to reach out to 
	 someone newer than me" Don't let this hurt you.
	-The Forecast. Depending on the "forecast" you might have to work harder to get the result. Eg. Seahawks vs Raiders 
	 on a sunny day, vs Seahawks vs Buffalo Bills in -7 degree weather - you can still win, but you will need to work
	 harder and endure more. 
	-There will always be a solution. Don't be someone who will never give up.  
	-The cookie jar analogy - whenever someone needed confidence, this woman would reach into a "cookie jar" of slips of
	 previous successes and wins - this helps remind you of the confidence that you had in the past to win. For Adam, 
	 it was the wins from the Covid times when the offices were locked down. Post Covid, there was no recruitment and
	 Adam was sometimes the only person in the field with no opportunity to build a team. He stayed patient and got to
	 working on what he needed to do.   
	-Sometimes in the moment, you may not appreciate the challenge. Was in Denver with only 1 field rep, office not making
	 money, wife was pregnant and not working, you can imagine the challenge of this.

	Successful Habits - Noah Chang
	

	-The habits learned from the field - nothing really that groundbreaking or revolutionary, which is the point. 
	 An ordinary person with excellent habits will always beat someone who is great sometimes with bad habits.
	 Habits are simply consistent good actions.
	-Success isn't sexy, it's structured. Structure sells. Adam Newman (former CEO of WeWork) - WeWork was one of the
	 biggest growing companies around 2018-2019, but Adam Newman was eccentric and expensive, and in 2024 WeWork filed
	 for bankruptcy - the failure was because of his leadership and lack of structure and illogical expansion. 
	-Donald Trump and his flip flopping and instability. He is dangerous to even his own allies. 
	-Mastering the Mundane. The reality of not being the same person as the Office owner you were in - even though
	 the owner keeps saying "you can do what I can do" despite the major differences. In this dynamic, what are
	 the things that you can replicate - structure, time keeping, habits, and best effort. You don't have to change
	 who you are, just replicate the things that work.
	-Pilots - they have checklists before every flight. Experience does not make you immune to mistakes, hence have
	 those structured checklists. Be able to explain and replicate that structure. The set structure that can be followed
	 at a high level consistency, that you and others can follow. 
	-The Blueprint -> Duplication -> Scale
	-Boring Basics beats Being Big. Money management, structure management, and being predictable. The basics over and over
	 when no one is watching. Personal management and structure of personal habits. Use peak hours efficiently. Structure
	 does evolve, and the small habits can change. However, the small things can have a huge impact whenever you're in
	 a higher position. 
	-Being able to say no to things like short term comfort. Being able to say no to laziness. Most people want the outcome
	 without the tradeoff. Avoid spontaneity sometimes if the spontaneity can be bad. Again you don't have to operate at
	 100% all the time as this can result in burnout and exhaustion, but that 93% consistently can give you the consistent
	 results you are looking for. 
	-Keep in Mind Murphy's Law, it's not if it will happen, it definitely will. The best way to counteract this is 
	 consistent good habits. Protect your prime hours.  
	-Noah's business Alta Nova didn't pop up out of nowhere, it popped up out of him running a satellite site, from
	 his habits, and the structure he learned and built for himself.
