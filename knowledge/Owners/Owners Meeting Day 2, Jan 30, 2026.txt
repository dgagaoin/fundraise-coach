Owners Meeting Day 2, Jan 30, 2026


OmarK's topic (Recruiting)

1) What is my company's story - "I want people to feel like they're in the number 1 place."

   Even with a small team, the goal is to get to 30+ people. The goal is to give people an opportunity and 
   people on the team need to understand and feel that.

   - Starts with the AD. On Indeed don't use the customer service style. Use a fundraiser representative ad.

   - The system in place. During interviews be with very very direct. Mention the base pay, face to face fundraising,
     opportunity.

   - The phone call. The expectation, every admin should be doing 100-150 calls per day, booking in 30 people.
     120 applicants on the Ad, this might need multiple admins. Every applicant should be getting 3 calls. 

     * I saw your application, are you still looking for the job...(booking phone call) very direct. It is a sales
       company, but we only work with charities etc.. Spell it out and say exactly what we do - set up a trade booth,
       interact with people. Don't use the word "events" - instead we partner up with business stores and interact
       with the general public. People who come in have a very clear understanding of what we actually do.
     * 1st rounds in Person. 2nd rounds in person. Individual interviews, 1 on 1 for first rounds. 2nd rounds are
       groups.

   - In the emails, there are clear directions as to where the office is. Not just directions, pictures of where to
     go so that they have a visual. 

   - In the interviews there are pastries and coffee; you want to be personable with the people coming in. 

   - How first rounds are done: 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 max.

       1) Introductions - expectations and why we're recruiting, its how we get to know you, how you get to know us.
	     10-15 minutes. 2nd rounds are longer - 45 minutes.

           Why we're recruiting, expansion - goal to get to the office to 60 people so that when we send people out
             the office is still healthy and staffed. (Never worry too much if talking about expansion is too much,
             its good for social proof, but still the potential new start cares more about what's in it for them). 
      
           Be very clear about the hours and the commute (build rapport here).


       2) Body - either build rapport or move on. Depends on how rapport went in introductions.

  	    What are you looking for? Usually 5 things - job stability, opportunity, growth, 

 	    About Us - go over what was said in the phone call, but expand more on it. Direct marketing vs Indirect 
		(Instagram example). Then what we do, partner with groceries stores, pet stores, spots where we 
		can do face to face. Use apple example - biggest tech company, but they still have apple stores
		and still do face to face sales. *note during the interview be personable and relatable - anime,
		sports, cars - have those memorabilia in there. Always be in control of the rapport (can use 
		time 15 minutes to keep control). Keep red flags in mind - not professional, bad mouthing previous
		company, trauma dumping. Can use, "hey we have everything we need, we'll reach out if we decide to
		offer you the position.

	    Pay structure - commission and performance based, plus low base pay. Be very up front - in the original 
		Ad as well as the 1st round. Just raising awareness is not the goal, it is to sign people up. We incentivize 			performance over time. Ask "why do you think you'll be successful here given that it is commission and
		performance based. Can explain 3 different ways of getting paid - hourly, salary, commission, we do 
		fall under commission obviously, being a sales company. Can explain out the average of the company.
		"Topping up" is just explained as a base pay. 

      3) Wrap Up - recap. If you decide to hire someone, offer to bring them back on the spot, if not, tell them 
		you have more interviews to go over and then we'll reach back out to them at the end of the day. Give
		them a paper that gives them something to do that has some of the questions that will be asked - it 
		helps them pre-think about it before they get to the interview - set them up to give you a better 
		interview. Put the time for the 2nd rounds on the paper. If there's a time number, you are bringing them
		back for the 2nd round, if there's no time number, you're not gonna bring them back. Be careful to not
		make it sound like you're giving the job just yet. Admins prep people and are told to dress sharp. 



   - 2nd Round Interviews: Do big groups. Have zero confusion as to what is going on. No events, no need to sell the idea
		any more. Start with people having the final evaluation forms - the last things we look at when we decide
		who gets the job. Go over route to market, then get them to answer the question on the paper. You get
		to see who has the best answers and who wants to volunteer to speak. Get people to talk, but everyone
		gets to answer on paper, the most confident ones speak up. Admins can call at the end of the day! Finish
		the second rounds with expectations. "This is what's gonna happen next...this is what's gonna happen next..."


   - Things to avoid: No customer service ad on indeed (do a sales representative or fundraiser ad). Do not use the word
		events. We have trade booths. Look at it as I love what we do - give that energy and vibe to others.

Michael Scully

	Always have a powerful story to tell. Sell people on 'you'.

        Bouncing Back (The Renewal) by Sarah Kim

	Started with 6 people, 2 piece average. Early momentum was not maintained for long term stability. 
	Problems with team culture, admin was terrible at recruiting. Knew needed to make changes to her team
	but didn't because she didn't want to 'hurt' peoples feelings. Had a hard time having tough conversations.
	Started blaming the territory. Business paid the price for all of the mistakes. Had to relearn lessons
	in from the field. "Results should not dictate attitude, Attitude should dictate results." Became reactive
	and lost confidence, and lost faith in the opportunity. 

	"Stop feeling bad for the wrong people." -Michael Scully, "you should be feeling bad for yourself, your
	business, and the people you haven't even hired yet." Misplaced compassion can severely hurt, until you
	learn to lay down the law. Don't let other people control your business. "Some fires aren't there to destroy,
	their there to clear dead growth and create space for new growth." There are necessary clearings and changes.
	"Doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity." 
	-Albert Einstein. Avoid building a victim and scarcity mindset. Just hold yourself accountable. Don't
	let your feelings run your business. 

	Rebuilding ('Ahah' moments)

	-Resolve to not fail this.
	-Resolve to not give up.
	-Make success a need not a want.
	-Don't protect feelings, protect the business.
	-Don't generalize the entire team, look at individuals.
	-People are going to talk badly about you because you are the boss.
	-The job is to recruit, to train, to set the standards, expect BS to happen, to work on yourself, have fun doing it.
	-Law of averages with Admins, recruitment and team members. People can matter in the moment even if they don't stay
	 long term. 
	-I just takes 2 weeks to turn things around.
	-You don't need to feel confident at first, you just need to act first. Motion creates emotion. 

	Reinforcing
	-Stop worrying about head count, low performers
	-The right people will understand why standards exist, why tough conversations matter, why accountability matters.
	-She just got better and with more clarity and proper leadership. 

	"Forests might not look great after a fire, but roots are still growing under the surface."

	Scoring Ain't Boring - Luisa

	2 offices: 
	- 40 people, 50% scoring ratio 1.5 average - 30 sales
	- 30 ppl 75%, 1.5 avg - 36 sales 

	Difference between more guys in field and less ratio vs less guys higher ratio. Higher scoring ratio is more important

	Managing performance - Collective vs Individual

	Collective: 
	- In meetings - recognition.
	- Winelist - is there someone taking away from the general performance of the team? Jacob fired 2 girls and in turn
	  that brought up the numbers of the entire team. "It is easier to give birth than to resurrect the dead." 
	  Teach leaders to interpret their own winelists.  
	- Sales impacts - help the technical skills of the team, help them make more money for themselves and the charities.
	- Master class training sessions. 
	- Setting proper expectations. The goal is to build people up, train people up to be able to perform. 

	Individual:	
	- Expectations sheets with new people on the team. 
	- Bonuses and incentives
	- Hire Quick, Fire Quick. Don't lower the standards so that it hurts the team.
	- 1 on 1 meetings. Goal 8-10 a week. Expectations is to ring bells. 
	- Figure out right away is it skillset or mindset? You can bring a horse to water but you can't make them drink it.
	- KPIs - evaluate people's performance. 
	- Phone calls throughout the day - when they're doing well and when they're not doing well. 
	- Hold Leaders accountable. 

	
	Have better systems, faster interventions.

	Running a Great Sales and Marketing Business - Ali Mir (Runs the UK BriteVox)

	-800 brand ambassadors the UK

	-Ethos - Everyday I run my marketing company, my role and responsibility is to replace myself. I am constantly
	 under watch by the people who come into my business, and I am constantly watching the people in my business
	 for those who can replace me. 

	-Everything you do will be either magnified or reduced down. Remember the 2/3rds and 4/3rds rule - people will copy
	 2/3rds of your good habits, and 4/3rds of your bad habits.
	-Mission is to recruit A players, but you will always get B and C players. A players are individuals that operate
	 with their own initiative, have self esteem, and have motivation that is intrinsic. They can inspire other people
	 and drive other people. Embody, "With me or without me" I will succeed.
	-How this relates to managing a company - if you have better people, it will be easier to manage your company
	-80/20 rule. 80% of your results will come from 20% of your people. Or 20% of your people will drive 80% of your
	 culture and performance. Drive the top 20%
	-Getting guys scoring and being better at fundraising - there's a common theme among top performers in sports - 
	 training days need to be like it's the "Superbowl" , the big game. Tom Brady and Jerry Rice trained like this. 
	 The 2 hours of training dictate the 6-8 hours in the field. How you run this 90 minutes or 2 hour training; the 
	 intensity and the mindset follow through into the field. Get people into that right space of intensity and mindset.
	 *what does this mean in laymans terms? Are people just running practice and impacts just for running them or is 
	  there a strategy in place? Is an impact run with thought and intention? If the strategy always the same and no
	  thought put into it, then bad results can follow. How good is the sales coaching? Focus on the mechanics. 
	-Keep in mind how do you operate in different territories, demographics, and with different people.
	-Be in the room with the best people. When the best people are running impacts, practice what they are speaking on.
	-You actually don't need to get every single individual practicing, 90% will learn from the 10% of the best performers
	 who do practice.  
	-Morning meetings - motivation is critical. But the other part to it is focus - which is subconscious, not conscious.
	 That subconscious focus creates a feeling and a belief system within the person (credit to Tony Robbins). The
	 subconscious focus might have negatives that people are operating on without even know. Subconscious focus is changed
	 when people are given things to think about, motivation, stories, to change their internal focus and messaging
	 to something beneficial. A great morning meeting speaks to the subconscious. If morale is high, performance is high.
	 Be a good story teller - your ability to be a great story teller can dictate how many people will follow you, how
	 many people will buy into you. 
	-Focus on how amazing this is. You don't have to be great to start, but you have to develop it. How to challenge AND
	 motivate people with a smile on your face. 
	-What do you do to keep people accountable and performing? One to ones - don't be scared of challenging people. 
	 No one leaves because you're tough on people or challenging people if it is coming from a good place. People do 
	 leave because they aren't making as much money as they want to. The only way to counter this is to have the ability
	 to have these one to one conversations.
	-Keep in mind that you're not looking for friends, if that happens great, but you are here to look for winners and 
	 to have an impact on people's lives. If you feel someone is walking through the business and not performing to their
	 potential, then you need to have those one to ones. You don't need people to like you, but you do need them to 
	 respect you. Don't be scared of challenging people, even the top performers, everyone needs to be challenged to be
	 successful. "If I don't challenge people, then what is the point of me being here? That is part of the role."
	 You are there to build high performers. The ultimate thing you're trying to get to, is to get someone's 
	 conscious to hold themselves accountable. Great coaches keep people on their toes. Having the nerves is a good thing,
	 that helps you perform to the high level that you can. 
	-What do you see in the mirror when you look at yourself? Is it a winner? Are the results you get a reflection of this 
	 as well. 
	-Being able to look someone straight in the eye and being able to say, "I'm being frank, but I think you can be better."
	 Look at the data and the KPIs - data is king. Inner instinct should also be tuned into in order to have these one to one's
	 with people. 
	
	-Learn to sit with the business owner and discuss how the business is going (in the US you can do it in the morning since
	 we don't come back to the office at the end of the day). You need to prep, think through, and discuss the entire team. 
 	 the more people involved in doing this, the
	-Your time as a business partner or Assistant Owner should be tougher than your time as a business owner. "You
	 can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect the dots after time has passed" - Steve Jobs. The 
	 training for running an office doesn't start as a business partner/assistant owner, it starts when you're a leader.
	 The bigger your business, the bigger the pressure. You have to be able to handle the pressure. You have to be able to 
	 put people under a good amount of pressure. 
	-Then training comes for recruitment, finance, running the admin team, and the backend. 
	-1 office can produce 15+ owners when things are done right. Be demanding of these standards. 
	-Part of the job is to impart the skills and make people mentally ready.
