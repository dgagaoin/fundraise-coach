## Core Story (Full Version – 8–10 minutes)

Sarah Kim built early momentum.

She started with a team of six people, averaging two pieces per person. Things looked promising at first—but the momentum didn’t last.

Over time, cracks formed.

Team culture weakened.
Administrative recruiting was inconsistent.
Standards slipped.

Sarah saw the problems clearly—but avoided addressing them.

She didn’t want to hurt people’s feelings.
She struggled with tough conversations.

And because of that, the business paid the price.

Instead of correcting the issues, Sarah began blaming external factors.

The territory.
The timing.
The circumstances.

As results dropped, her attitude followed.

She became reactive.
She lost confidence.
She began losing faith in the opportunity itself.

That’s when a hard truth landed.

> “Results should not dictate attitude. Attitude should dictate results.”

Another perspective cut even deeper:

> “Stop feeling bad for the wrong people. You should be feeling bad for yourself, your business, and the people you haven’t even hired yet.”
> — Michael Scully

Sarah realized her compassion was misplaced.

By protecting feelings, she was damaging the business.
By avoiding standards, she was limiting growth.

Some fires aren’t there to destroy.

They’re there to clear dead growth and make space for new life.

The reset began with accountability.

Not excuses.

Not emotion.

Ownership.

## The Rebuild (Aha Moments)

Sarah made several firm decisions:

* Resolve to not fail
* Resolve to not quit
* Make success a **need**, not a want
* Stop protecting feelings—protect the business
* Address individuals, not generalize the whole team
* Accept that people will talk when you lead

She reframed the role of leadership:

The job is to recruit.
The job is to train.
The job is to set standards.
The job is to expect challenges.
The job is to work on yourself.

And to enjoy the process.

She stopped obsessing over headcount and low performers.

Instead, she focused on clarity, standards, and consistency.

She remembered another hard truth:

> Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the definition of insanity.

Accountability replaced emotion.

Action replaced hesitation.

And something shifted—fast.

## Reinforcement & Renewal

Sarah learned that:

* The right people respect standards
* Tough conversations build trust
* Confidence follows action, not the other way around
* Momentum can return quickly with clarity

In fact, it often takes **as little as two weeks** to turn things around.

The forest may not look beautiful after a fire.

But beneath the surface, roots are already growing.

Renewal doesn’t come from comfort.

It comes from courage.
