# What I Learned Opening 3 Marketing Companies in 1 Year

### Carlos U — Structure, Confidence, and Scalable Leadership

---

## Core Premise

Opening and supporting multiple businesses revealed one central truth:

**Confidence is built through structure — not hype.**

Leaders succeed when they understand *what* they are doing, *why* they are doing it, and consistently follow through.

---

## Confidence Through Structure

### The 2/3 – 4/3 Rule (Reinforced)

* People copy **2/3 of your good habits**
* People copy **4/3 of your bad habits**

Everything you do is amplified through your team.

Structure protects confidence.

---

## What Is Unshakeable Confidence?

**Unshakeable confidence = keeping your word.**

You trust what you say because you do what you say.

Leaders must deeply understand the *why* behind the structure:

* Leaders meetings
* Morning meetings
* Prime time
* Sales impacts
* One-to-ones
* Winelists
* Interviews & orientations
* Pre-management meetings
* Super Saturdays

Assistant Owners and Business Partners must:

* Spend time running these systems
* Observe them in action
* Execute them consistently

---

## Balancing Office Time and the Field

Leadership does not replace field credibility.

Recommended rhythms:

* **3 days office / 2 days field**
* or **2 days office / 3 days field**

Non-negotiables:

* Even on office-heavy days, still hit the field
* Less field time = **higher intensity** in the field

Presence builds trust.

---

## Training Leaders the Right Way

Leaders must be trained to do *everything*:

* One-to-ones
* Sales impacts
* Leaders meetings
* Morning meetings
* Booking interviews
* Booking sites

### The 3-Month Rule

Have leaders do all of this **every week for three months**.

It will be hard.

But sustained repetition turns hard work into ease.

---

## Individualized Development

Everyone is different.

Great leaders:

* Lean into strengths
* Identify weaknesses
* Remove blockers that slow growth

Development is personal — not one-size-fits-all.

---

## What I Would Do Differently

With hindsight, Carlos would:

* Prepare more before expansion
* Set clearer recruitment goals
* Review data more consistently
* Manage administrators and winelists more tightly
* Track balance sheets more closely
* Build **more first-generation leaders** before promoting people out
* Run more crew nights with newer reps
* Go on **4–5 road trips per year** as an owner to develop people
* Track KPIs more rigorously

Even when things are going well, improvement is always possible.

---

## Teaching Top Performer Characteristics

Part of leadership is explicitly teaching:

* What excellence looks like
* How top performers think
* How top performers act

Success becomes repeatable when standards are visible.

---

## Core Lesson

**Structure creates confidence. Consistency creates scale.**

Leaders don’t guess.

They execute.
